<p class="homepage-title-1">What is this?</p>
<p class="homepage-text">
    This is the complementary web-page for Eurographics 2022 State-of-The-Art Report
    (under review): <i><a href="">Neural Fields in Visual Computing and Beyond</a></i>.
</p>
<p class="homepage-text">
    We aim to provide a comprehensive yet interactive database of all papers using
    the coordinate-based neural network technique.
</p>
<p class="homepage-text">
    For more in-depth discussions, please visit our <a href="">review paper</a>.

<p class="homepage-title-1">Features</p>
<!-- <p class="homepage-title-2">Filtering</p> -->
<p class="homepage-text">Users can filter out disired papers by applying one or multiple filters on papers' titles,
    authors, keywords, or publication dates.</p>
<img src="static/images/browse.gif" class="homepage-image">
<!-- <p class="homepage-title-2">Building a timeline</p> -->
<p class="homepage-text">A scrollable and zoomable timeline can be built given a set of papers. Users can use this
    feature to
    check the trajectory of how a certerin technique has evolved over time.

<p class="infopage-title-3">Data accuracy</p>
<p class="infopage-text">
    Up until the release date (Oct.29, 2021), all ~250 data entries were imported manually by our contributers.
    Please be patient with our mistakes. We encourage all authors to verify that the data corresponding
    to their papers are accurate by using our submission/editing tool (see instructions below). We also
    encourage all authors to update the venue, once an arXiv pre-print is accepted by a peer-reviewed venue.
</p>
<p class="infopage-title-3">Peer-review criteria</p>
<p class="infopage-text">
    In this website, we include all published results, which includes both
    peer-reviewed papers and arXiv pre-prints. We recognize the importance and rigor of peer-review,
    so we have included the venue in each paper's landing page. When searching, you may filter for
    peer-reviewed papers only by selecting the corresponding check box.
