<p class="infopage-text">
    Up until the release date (Oct.29, 2021), all ~250 data entries were imported manually by our contributers.
    Please be patient with our mistakes and we apologize if we have misrepresented your work by accident.
    We encourage all authors to verify that the data corresponding to your papers are accurate by using
    our submission/editing tool. We also encourage all authors to update the venue, once an arXiv pre-print
    is accepted by a peer-reviewed venue.

<p class="infopage-title-2">Peer-review criteria</p>
<p class="infopage-text">
    In this website, we include all published results, which includes both
    peer-reviewed papers and arXiv pre-prints. We recognize the importance and rigor of peer-review,
    so we have included the venue in each paper's landing page. When searching, you may filter for
    peer-reviewed papers only by selecting the corresponding check box.
