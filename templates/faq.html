<p class="infopage-title-2">Data accuracy</p>
<p class="infopage-text">
    Up until the release date (Oct.29, 2021), all ~250 data entries were imported manually by our contributers.
    Please be patient with our mistakes. We encourage all authors to verify that the data corresponding
    to their papers are accurate by using our submission/editing tool (see instructions below). We also
    encourage all authors to update the venue, once an arXiv pre-print is accepted by a peer-reviewed venue.
</p>
<p class="infopage-title-2">Peer-review criteria</p>
<p class="infopage-text">
    In this website, we include all published results, which includes both
    peer-reviewed papers and arXiv pre-prints. We recognize the importance and rigor of peer-review,
    so we have included the venue in each paper's landing page. When searching, you may filter for
    peer-reviewed papers only by selecting the corresponding check box.
