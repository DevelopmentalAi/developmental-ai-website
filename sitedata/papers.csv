Rehg","It is widely accepted that reasoning about object shape is important for object recognition. However, the most powerful object recognition methods today do not explicitly make
use of object shape during learning. In this work, motivated by recent developments in low-shot learning, findings in developmental psychology, and the increased use of synthetic data in computer vision research, we investigate how reasoning about 3D shape can be used to improve low-shot learning methods’ generalization performance. We propose a new way to improve existing low-shot learning approaches by learning a discriminative embedding space using 3D object shape, and using this embedding by learning how to map images into it. Our new approach improves the performance of image-only low-shot learning approaches
on multiple datasets. We also introduce Toys4K, a 3D object dataset with the largest number of object categories currently available, which supports low-shot learning.","@article{stojanov21cvpr,       title={Using Shape to Categorize: Low-Shot Learning with an Explicit Shape Bias},       author={Stefan Stojanov and Anh Thai and James M.

Barrett, Adam Santoro, Matt M. Botvinick","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented performance on a wide range of complex tasks, rapidly outpacing our understanding of the nature of their solutions. This has caused a recent surge of interest in methods for rendering modern neural systems more interpretable. In this work, we propose to address the interpretability problem in modern DNNs using the rich history of problem descriptions, theories and experimental methods developed by cognitive psychologists to study the human mind. To explore the potential value of these tools, we chose a well-established analysis from developmental psychology that explains how children learn word labels for objects, and applied that analysis to DNNs. Using datasets of stimuli inspired by the original cognitive psychology experiments, we find that state-of-the-art one shot learning models trained on ImageNet exhibit a similar bias to that observed in humans: they prefer to categorize objects according to shape rather than color. The magnitude of this shape bias varies greatly among architecturally identical, but differently seeded models, and even fluctuates within seeds throughout training, despite nearly equivalent classification performance. These results demonstrate the capability of tools from cognitive psychology for exposing hidden computational properties of DNNs, while concurrently providing us with a computational model for human word learning.","@inproceedings{ritter2017cognitive,   title={Cognitive psychology for deep neural networks: A shape bias case study},   author={Ritter, Samuel and Barrett, David GT and Santoro, Adam and Botvinick, Matt M},   booktitle={International conference on machine learning},   pages={2940--2949},   year={2017},   organization={PMLR} }","shape-bias, computer-vision, neural-networks",

The specific dimensions examined were shape, size, and texture. In four experiments, subjects were asked either to extend a novel count noun to new instances or, in a nonword classification task, to put together objects that go together. The subjects were 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds, and adults. The results of all four experiments indicate that 2- and 3-year-olds and adults all weight shape more heavily than they do size or texture. This observed emphasis on shape, however, depends on the age of the subject and the task. First, there is a developmental trend. The shape bias increases in strength and generality from 2 to 3 years of age and more markedly from early childhood to adulthood. Second, in young children, the shape bias is much stronger in word extension than in nonword classification tasks. These results suggest that the development of the shape bias originates in language learning—it reflects a fact about language—and does not stem from general perceptual processes.","@article{LANDAU1988299, title = {The importance of shape in early lexical learning}, journal = {Cognitive Development}, volume = {3}, number = {3}, pages = {299-321}, year = {1988}, issn = {0885-2014}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/0885-2014(88)90014-7}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0885201488900147}, author = {Barbara Landau and Linda B.

Rehg","A hallmark of the deep learning era for computer vision is the successful use of
large-scale labeled datasets to train feature representations for tasks ranging from
object recognition and semantic segmentation to optical flow estimation and novel
view synthesis of 3D scenes. In this work, we aim to learn dense discriminative
object representations for low-shot category recognition without requiring any
category labels. To this end, we propose Deep Object Patch Encodings (DOPE),
which can be trained from multiple views of object instances without any category
or semantic object part labels. To train DOPE, we assume access to sparse depths,
foreground masks and known cameras, to obtain pixel-level correspondences
between views of an object, and use this to formulate a self-supervised learning
task to learn discriminative object patches. We find that DOPE can directly be used
for low-shot classification of novel categories using local-part matching, and is
competitive with and outperforms supervised and self-supervised learning baselines.","@inproceedings{stojanov2022learning,   title={Learning Dense Object Descriptors from Multiple Views for Low-shot Category Generalization},   author={Stojanov, Stefan and Thai, Ngoc Anh and Huang, Zixuan and Rehg, James Matthew},   booktitle={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems} }","self-supervised learning, low-shot learning",
