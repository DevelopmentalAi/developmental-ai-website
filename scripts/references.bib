  ABSTRACT = {Recent deep networks that directly handle points in a point set, e.g.,PointNet, have been state-of-the-art for supervised learning tasks on pointclouds such as classification and segmentation. In this work, a novelend-to-end deep auto-encoder is proposed to address unsupervised learningchallenges on point clouds. On the encoder side, a graph-based enhancement isenforced to promote local structures on top of PointNet. Then, a novelfolding-based decoder deforms a canonical 2D grid onto the underlying 3D objectsurface of a point cloud, achieving low reconstruction errors even for objectswith delicate structures. The proposed decoder only uses about 7% parameters ofa decoder with fully-connected neural networks, yet leads to a morediscriminative representation that achieves higher linear SVM classificationaccuracy than the benchmark. In addition, the proposed decoder structure isshown, in theory, to be a generic architecture that is able to reconstruct anarbitrary point cloud from a 2D grid.

  ABSTRACT = {The reconstruction of a discrete surface from a point cloud is a fundamentalgeometry processing problem that has been studied for decades, with manymethods developed. We propose the use of a deep neural network as a geometricprior for surface reconstruction. Specifically, we overfit a neural networkrepresenting a local chart parameterization to part of an input point cloudusing the Wasserstein distance as a measure of approximation. By jointlyfitting many such networks to overlapping parts of the point cloud, whileenforcing a consistency condition, we compute a manifold atlas. By samplingthis atlas, we can produce a dense reconstruction of the surface approximatingthe input cloud. The entire procedure does not require any training data orexplicit regularization, yet, we show that it is able to perform remarkablywell: not introducing typical overfitting artifacts, and approximating sharpfeatures closely at the same time. We experimentally show that this geometricprior produces good results for both man-made objects containing sharp featuresand smoother organic objects, as well as noisy inputs. We compare our methodwith a number of well-known reconstruction methods on a standard surfacereconstruction benchmark.},

  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.GR},
  ABSTRACT = {We advocate the use of implicit fields for learning generative models ofshapes and introduce an implicit field decoder, called IM-NET, for shapegeneration, aimed at improving the visual quality of the generated shapes. Animplicit field assigns a value to each point in 3D space, so that a shape canbe extracted as an iso-surface. IM-NET is trained to perform this assignment bymeans of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, alongwith a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicateswhether the point is outside the shape or not. By replacing conventionaldecoders by our implicit decoder for representation learning (via IM-AE) andshape generation (via IM-GAN), we demonstrate superior results for tasks suchas generative shape modeling, interpolation, and single-view 3D reconstruction,particularly in terms of visual quality.

  ABSTRACT = {With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based approaches for 3Dreconstruction have gained popularity. However, unlike for images, in 3D thereis no canonical representation which is both computationally and memoryefficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrarytopology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstructionapproaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to arestricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a newrepresentation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networksimplicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of adeep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, ourrepresentation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolutionwithout excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation canefficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds ofinput. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively andquantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from singleimages, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe thatoccupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety oflearning-based 3D tasks.},

  ABSTRACT = {Computer graphics, 3D computer vision and robotics communities have producedmultiple approaches to representing 3D geometry for rendering andreconstruction. These provide trade-offs across fidelity, efficiency andcompression capabilities. In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learnedcontinuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a class of shapesthat enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completionfrom partial and noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart,represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude ofa point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and thesign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape,hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as thezero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing theclassification of space as being part of the shapes interior or not. Whileclassical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typicallyrepresent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire classof shapes. Furthermore, we show state-of-the-art performance for learned 3Dshape representation and completion while reducing the model size by an orderof magnitude compared with previous work.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce Pixel-aligned Implicit Function (PIFu), a highly effectiveimplicit representation that locally aligns pixels of 2D images with the globalcontext of their corresponding 3D object. Using PIFu, we propose an end-to-enddeep learning method for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that caninfer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multipleinput images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well astheir variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Comparedto existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu can producehigh-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of aperson. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation,can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially alignedwith the input image. Furthermore, while previous techniques are designed toprocess either a single image or multiple views, PIFu extends naturally toarbitrary number of views. We demonstrate high-resolution and robustreconstructions on real world images from the DeepFashion dataset, whichcontains a variety of challenging clothing types. Our method achievesstate-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark and outperforms the priorwork for clothed human digitization from a single image.},

  ABSTRACT = {In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in learning-basedreconstruction of 3D objects. At the same time, generative models were proposedthat can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success inthese closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has receivedlittle attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods areeither limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups.A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of textureare inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. Inthis paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which isbased on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neuralnetwork. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretizationand parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent ofthe shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are ableto represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deeplearning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields comparefavorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturingunseen 3D models. We believe that Texture Fields will become an importantbuilding block for the next generation of generative 3D models.},

  ABSTRACT = {The level sets of neural networks represent fundamental properties such asdecision boundaries of classifiers and are used to model non-linear manifolddata such as curves and surfaces. Thus, methods for controlling the neurallevel sets could find many applications in machine learning.In this paper we present a simple and scalable approach to directly controllevel sets of a deep neural network. Our method consists of two parts: (i)sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples' positions tothe network parameters. The latter is achieved by a sample network that isconstructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. Inturn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples intoa loss function of interest.We have tested our method on three different learning tasks: improvinggeneralization to unseen data, training networks robust to adversarial attacks,and curve and surface reconstruction from point clouds. For surfacereconstruction, we produce high fidelity surfaces directly from raw 3D pointclouds. When training small to medium networks to be robust to adversarialattacks we obtain robust accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Unsupervised learning with generative models has the potential of discoveringrich representations of 3D scenes. While geometric deep learning has explored3D-structure-aware representations of scene geometry, these models typicallyrequire explicit 3D supervision. Emerging neural scene representations can betrained only with posed 2D images, but existing methods ignore thethree-dimensional structure of scenes. We propose Scene Representation Networks(SRNs), a continuous, 3D-structure-aware scene representation that encodes bothgeometry and appearance. SRNs represent scenes as continuous functions that mapworld coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. Byformulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm,SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses,without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes acrossscenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process. Wedemonstrate the potential of SRNs by evaluating them for novel view synthesis,few-shot reconstruction, joint shape and appearance interpolation, andunsupervised discovery of a non-rigid face model.},

  ABSTRACT = {Modeling and rendering of dynamic scenes is challenging, as natural scenesoften contain complex phenomena such as thin structures, evolving topology,translucency, scattering, occlusion, and biological motion. Mesh-basedreconstruction and tracking often fail in these cases, and other approaches(e.g., light field video) typically rely on constrained viewing conditions,which limit interactivity. We circumvent these difficulties by presenting alearning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by theintegral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach issupervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does notrequire explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has twoprimary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input imagesinto a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operationthat enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, ourconstruction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-spacerendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latentrepresentation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel contentsequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations ofvoxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structureimplemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatlyimproves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jaggedmotion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-basedrepresentations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications wherethe highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a casein point.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in 3D deep learning have shown that it is possible to trainhighly effective deep models for 3D shape generation, directly from 2D images.This is particularly interesting since the availability of 3D models is stilllimited compared to the massive amount of accessible 2D images, which isinvaluable for training. The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a keyfactor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicitrepresentations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range ofshape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-basedrepresentations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handlevarying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complexshapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We addressthe fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inferencewithout the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remainsnontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicitsurfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision;and (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as localsmoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known tobe a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we proposea novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-fieldsupervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces,which provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstratethe effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3Dshape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques bothquantitatively and qualitatively.},

Inthis work, we propose a differentiable rendering formulation for implicit shapeand texture representations. Implicit representations have recently gainedpopularity as they represent shape and texture continuously. Our key insight isthat depth gradients can be derived analytically using the concept of implicitdifferentiation. This allows us to learn implicit shape and texturerepresentations directly from RGB images. We experimentally show that oursingle-view reconstructions rival those learned with full 3D supervision.Moreover, we find that our method can be used for multi-view 3D reconstruction,directly resulting in watertight meshes.},

In this paper we offer a new paradigm for computing highfidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (i.e., pointclouds, with or without normal information). We observe that a rather simpleloss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input pointcloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses an implicit geometricregularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level set surfaces,avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of thisproperty for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads tostate of the art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-detailsand fidelity compared to previous methods.},

  ARCHIVEPREFIX = {arXiv},
  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {While many works focus on 3D reconstruction from images, in this paper, wefocus on 3D shape reconstruction and completion from a variety of 3D inputs,which are deficient in some respect: low and high resolution voxels, sparse anddense point clouds, complete or incomplete. Processing of such 3D inputs is anincreasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which arebecoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer visionalgorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise asthey produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitationsin reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are notretained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, wepropose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs,can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse inputdata retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, butcritically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data,and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in twocrucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape,we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, whichis aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second,instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deepfeatures extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show thatthis forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shapestructure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclideantransformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets clearly outperform priorwork in 3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly moreaccurate 3D human reconstructions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recently, implicit neural representations have gained popularity forlearning-based 3D reconstruction. While demonstrating promising results, mostimplicit approaches are limited to comparably simple geometry of single objectsand do not scale to more complicated or large-scale scenes. The key limitingfactor of implicit methods is their simple fully-connected network architecturewhich does not allow for integrating local information in the observations orincorporating inductive biases such as translational equivariance. In thispaper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicitrepresentation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. Bycombining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our modelincorporates inductive biases, enabling structured reasoning in 3D space. Weinvestigate the effectiveness of the proposed representation by reconstructingcomplex geometry from noisy point clouds and low-resolution voxelrepresentations. We empirically find that our method enables the fine-grainedimplicit 3D reconstruction of single objects, scales to large indoor scenes,and generalizes well from synthetic to real data.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizingnovel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetricscene function using a sparse set of input views.

We synthesize viewsby querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume renderingtechniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Becausevolume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required tooptimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. Wedescribe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to renderphotorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance,and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and viewsynthesis.

  ABSTRACT = {Efficiently reconstructing complex and intricate surfaces at scale is along-standing goal in machine perception. To address this problem we introduceDeep Local Shapes (DeepLS), a deep shape representation that enables encodingand reconstruction of high-quality 3D shapes without prohibitive memoryrequirements. DeepLS replaces the dense volumetric signed distance function(SDF) representation used in traditional surface reconstruction systems with aset of locally learned continuous SDFs defined by a neural network, inspired byrecent work such as DeepSDF. Unlike DeepSDF, which represents an object-levelSDF with a neural network and a single latent code, we store a grid ofindependent latent codes, each responsible for storing information aboutsurfaces in a small local neighborhood. This decomposition of scenes into localshapes simplifies the prior distribution that the network must learn, and alsoenables efficient inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness andgeneralization power of DeepLS by showing object shape encoding andreconstructions of full scenes, where DeepLS delivers high compression,accuracy, and local shape completion.},

  ABSTRACT = {The recent success of implicit neural scene representations has presented aviable new method for how we capture and store 3D scenes. Unlike conventional3D representations, such as point clouds, which explicitly store sceneproperties in discrete, localized units, these implicit representations encodea scene in the weights of a neural network which can be queried at anycoordinate to produce these same scene properties. Thus far, implicitrepresentations have primarily been optimized to estimate only the appearanceand/or 3D geometry information in a scene. We take the next step anddemonstrate that an existing implicit representation (SRNs) is actuallymulti-modal; it can be further leveraged to perform per-point semanticsegmentation while retaining its ability to represent appearance and geometry.To achieve this multi-modal behavior, we utilize a semi-supervised learningstrategy atop the existing pre-trained scene representation. Our method issimple, general, and only requires a few tens of labeled 2D segmentation masksin order to achieve dense 3D semantic segmentation. We explore two novelapplications for this semantically aware implicit neural scene representation:3D novel view and semantic label synthesis given only a single input RGB imageor 2D label mask, as well as 3D interpolation of appearance and semantics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in image-based 3D human shape estimation have been driven bythe significant improvement in representation power afforded by deep neuralnetworks. Although current approaches have demonstrated the potential in realworld settings, they still fail to produce reconstructions with the level ofdetail often present in the input images. We argue that this limitation stemsprimarily form two conflicting requirements; accurate predictions require largecontext, but precise predictions require high resolution. Due to memorylimitations in current hardware, previous approaches tend to take lowresolution images as input to cover large spatial context, and produce lessprecise (or low resolution) 3D estimates as a result. We address thislimitation by formulating a multi-level architecture that is end-to-endtrainable. A coarse level observes the whole image at lower resolution andfocuses on holistic reasoning. This provides context to an fine level whichestimates highly detailed geometry by observing higher-resolution images. Wedemonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existingstate-of-the-art techniques on single image human shape reconstruction by fullyleveraging 1k-resolution input images.},

We propose DualSDF, arepresentation expressing shapes at two levels of granularity, one capturingfine details and the other representing an abstracted proxy shape using simpleand semantically consistent shape primitives. To achieve a tight couplingbetween the two representations, we use a variational objective over a sharedlatent space. Our two-level model gives rise to a new shape manipulationtechnique in which a user can interactively manipulate the coarse proxy shapeand see the changes instantly mirrored in the high-resolution shape. Moreover,our model actively augments and guides the manipulation towards producingsemantically meaningful shapes, making complex manipulations possible withminimal user input.},

  ABSTRACT = {While 2D generative adversarial networks have enabled high-resolution imagesynthesis, they largely lack an understanding of the 3D world and the imageformation process. Thus, they do not provide precise control over cameraviewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approachesleverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination withdifferentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low imageresolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g.,the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose agenerative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful fornovel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-basedrepresentations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization ofthe 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties whiledegrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. Byintroducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesisof high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D imagesalone. We systematically analyze our approach on several challenging syntheticand real-world datasets. Our experiments reveal that radiance fields are apowerful representation for generative image synthesis, leading to 3Dconsistent models that render with high fidelity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Photo-realistic free-viewpoint rendering of real-world scenes using classicalcomputer graphics techniques is challenging, because it requires the difficultstep of capturing detailed appearance and geometry models. Recent studies havedemonstrated promising results by learning scene representations thatimplicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However,existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by thelimited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections ofcamera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery fromthese representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. Inthis work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scenerepresentation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF definesa set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree tomodel local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlyingvoxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a setof posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novelviews can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scenecontent. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art(namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achievinghigher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxelrepresentation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scenecomposition. We also demonstrate several challenging tasks, includingmulti-scene learning, free-viewpoint rendering of a moving human, andlarge-scale scene rendering.

Inthis paper, we present a new mid-level patch-based surface representation. Atthe level of patches, objects across different categories share similarities,which leads to more generalizable models. We then introduce a novel method tolearn this patch-based representation in a canonical space, such that it is asobject-agnostic as possible. We show that our representation trained on onecategory of objects from ShapeNet can also well represent detailed shapes fromany other category. In addition, it can be trained using much fewer shapes,compared to existing approaches. We show several applications of our newrepresentation, including shape interpolation and partial point cloudcompletion. Due to explicit control over positions, orientations and scales ofpatches, our representation is also more controllable compared to object-levelrepresentations, which enables us to deform encoded shapes non-rigidly.},

Wedemonstrate that neural reflectance fields can be estimated from imagescaptured with a simple collocated camera-light setup, and accurately model theappearance of real-world scenes with complex geometry and reflectance. Onceestimated, they can be used to render photo-realistic images under novelviewpoint and (non-collocated) lighting conditions and accurately reproducechallenging effects like specularities, shadows and occlusions. This allows usto perform high-quality view synthesis and relighting that is significantlybetter than previous methods. We also demonstrate that we can compose theestimated neural reflectance field of a real scene with traditional scenemodels and render them using standard Monte Carlo rendering engines. Our workthus enables a complete pipeline from high-quality and practical appearanceacquisition to 3D scene composition and rendering.},

  ABSTRACT = {A neural implicit outputs a number indicating whether the given query pointin space is inside, outside, or on a surface. Many prior works have focused on_latent-encoded_ neural implicits, where a latent vector encoding of a specificshape is also fed as input. While affording latent-space interpolation, thiscomes at the cost of reconstruction accuracy for any _single_ shape. Training aspecific network for each 3D shape, a _weight-encoded_ neural implicit mayforgo the latent vector and focus reconstruction accuracy on the details of asingle shape. While previously considered as an intermediary representation for3D scanning tasks or as a toy-problem leading up to latent-encoding tasks,weight-encoded neural implicits have not yet been taken seriously as a 3D shaperepresentation. In this paper, we establish that weight-encoded neuralimplicits meet the criteria of a first-class 3D shape representation. Weintroduce a suite of technical contributions to improve reconstructionaccuracy, convergence, and robustness when learning the signed distance fieldinduced by a polygonal mesh -- the _de facto_ standard representation. Viewedas a lossy compression, our conversion outperforms standard techniques fromgeometry processing. Compared to previous latent- and weight-encoded neuralimplicits we demonstrate superior robustness, scalability, and performance.},

  ABSTRACT = {Prior work to infer 3D texture use either texture atlases, which requireuv-mappings and hence have discontinuities, or colored voxels, which are memoryinefficient and limited in resolution. Recent work, predicts RGB color at everyXYZ coordinate forming a texture field, but focus on completing texture given asingle 2D image. Instead, we focus on 3D texture and geometry completion frompartial and incomplete 3D scans. IF-Nets have recently achievedstate-of-the-art results on 3D geometry completion using a multi-scale deepfeature encoding, but the outputs lack texture. In this work, we generalizeIF-Nets to texture completion from partial textured scans of humans andarbitrary objects. Our key insight is that 3D texture completion benefits fromincorporating local and global deep features extracted from both the 3D partialtexture and completed geometry. Specifically, given the partial 3D texture andthe 3D geometry completed with IF-Nets, our model successfully in-paints themissing texture parts in consistence with the completed geometry. Our model wonthe SHARP ECCV'20 challenge, achieving highest performance on all challenges.},

Executing this NN at newcoordinates results in joint view, time or light interpolation. The key idea tomake this workable is a NN that already knows the "basic tricks" of graphics(lighting, 3D projection, occlusion) in a hard-coded and differentiable form.The NN represents the input to that rendering as an implicit map, that for anyview, time, or light coordinate and for any pixel can quantify how it will moveif view, time or light coordinates change (Jacobian of pixel position withrespect to view, time, illumination, etc.).

  ABSTRACT = {Dense 3D object reconstruction from a single image has recently witnessedremarkable advances, but supervising neural networks with ground-truth 3Dshapes is impractical due to the laborious process of creating pairedimage-shape datasets. Recent efforts have turned to learning 3D reconstructionwithout 3D supervision from RGB images with annotated 2D silhouettes,dramatically reducing the cost and effort of annotation. These techniques,however, remain impractical as they still require multi-view annotations of thesame object instance during training. As a result, most experimental efforts todate have been limited to synthetic datasets. In this paper, we address thisissue and propose SDF-SRN, an approach that requires only a single view ofobjects at training time, offering greater utility for real-world scenarios.SDF-SRN learns implicit 3D shape representations to handle arbitrary shapetopologies that may exist in the datasets. To this end, we derive a noveldifferentiable rendering formulation for learning signed distance functions(SDF) from 2D silhouettes. Our method outperforms the state of the art underchallenging single-view supervision settings on both synthetic and real-worlddatasets.},

  ARCHIVEPREFIX = {arXiv},
  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {In this work we target a learnable output representation that allowscontinuous, high resolution outputs of arbitrary shape. Recent works represent3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previousbarriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However,neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which dividethe space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of ascene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are notclosed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing(objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability tooutput open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), aneural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field forarbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at highresolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data,and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDFallow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We alsoshow that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using aslight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-targetregression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have beenexclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show thatNDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapeswith inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show thatNDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general opensurfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions.

While several recent works investigate how todisentangle underlying factors of variation in the data, most of them operatein 2D and hence ignore that our world is three-dimensional. Further, only fewworks consider the compositional nature of scenes. Our key hypothesis is thatincorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative modelleads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes ascompositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one ormultiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes andappearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collectionswithout any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with aneural rendering pipeline yields a fast and realistic image synthesis model. Asevidenced by our experiments, our model is able to disentangle individualobjects and allows for translating and rotating them in the scene as well aschanging the camera pose.},

  ABSTRACT = {In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixelarrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image isrepresented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predictsan RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose twonovel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them tobuild a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRsfor image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale tocomplex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves theperformance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducingthe gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, weexplore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, likeout-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation,accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolateoutside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior.

Yet,generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting theirapplicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a techniquebased on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our keyobservation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeperand/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene anddedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together,these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constantinference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we showthat a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it isprovably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendlyrendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method providesup to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality),or an improvement of up to 1.0~dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural rendering techniques combining machine learning with geometricreasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizingnovel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out theNeural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D inputcoordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volumedensity and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving anunprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is onlyapplicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queriedfrom different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extendsneural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and rendernovel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single}camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as anadditional input to the system, and split the learning process in two mainstages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that mapsthis canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time.Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Oncethe networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both thecamera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects underrigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamicscenes dataset will be released.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neuralscene representation conditioned on one or few input images. The existingapproach for constructing neural radiance fields involves optimizing therepresentation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated viewsand significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving theseshortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on imageinputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trainedacross multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novelview synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few asone). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can betrained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conductextensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel viewsynthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories. Wefurther demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it onmulti-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In allcases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel viewsynthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

  ABSTRACT = {Coordinate-based neural representations have shown significant promise as analternative to discrete, array-based representations for complex lowdimensional signals. However, optimizing a coordinate-based network fromrandomly initialized weights for each new signal is inefficient. We proposeapplying standard meta-learning algorithms to learn the initial weightparameters for these fully-connected networks based on the underlying class ofsignals being represented (e.g., images of faces or 3D models of chairs).Despite requiring only a minor change in implementation, using these learnedinitial weights enables faster convergence during optimization and can serve asa strong prior over the signal class being modeled, resulting in bettergeneralization when only partial observations of a given signal are available.We explore these benefits across a variety of tasks, including representing 2Dimages, reconstructing CT scans, and recovering 3D shapes and scenes from 2Dimage observations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing andis at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications,neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for viewsynthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamentalobstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational andmemory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along therendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiringhundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximatethose integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automaticintegration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions tointegrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiatethe computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. Thegraph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemblethe graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By thefundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definiteintegral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neuralrendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality:improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightlyreduced image quality.},

In contrast tostate-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material propertiesexplicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representationof the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics ofthe face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensionalmorphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. Weuse volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation anddemonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned frommonocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. Inour experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows forphoto-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-artvideo-based reenactment methods.},

Wetake three important steps to equip such a seemingly simple function withadequate expressivity. First, the parameters of the pixel-wise networks arespatially varying so they can represent a broader function class than simple1x1 convolutions. Second, these parameters are predicted by a fastconvolutional network that processes an aggressively low-resolutionrepresentation of the input; Third, we augment the input image with asinusoidal encoding of spatial coordinates, which provides an effectiveinductive bias for generating realistic novel high-frequency image content. Asa result, our model is up to 18x faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Weachieve this speedup while generating comparable visual quality acrossdifferent image resolutions and translation domains.},

The predicted visibility andsurface intersection fields are critical to our model's ability to simulatedirect and indirect illumination during training, because the brute-forcetechniques used by prior work are intractable for lighting conditions outsideof controlled setups with a single light.

  ABSTRACT = {Decomposing a scene into its shape, reflectance, and illumination is achallenging but essential problem in computer vision and graphics. This problemis inherently more challenging when the illumination is not a single lightsource under laboratory conditions but is instead an unconstrainedenvironmental illumination. Though recent work has shown that implicitrepresentations can be used to model the radiance field of an object, thesetechniques only enable view synthesis and not relighting. Additionally,evaluating these radiance fields is resource and time-intensive. By decomposinga scene into explicit representations, any rendering framework can be leveragedto generate novel views under any illumination in real-time. NeRD is a methodthat achieves this decomposition by introducing physically-based rendering toneural radiance fields. Even challenging non-Lambertian reflectances, complexgeometry, and unknown illumination can be decomposed into high-quality models.The datasets and code is available on the project page:https://markboss.me/publication/2021-nerd/},

In this work, weinvestigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free,RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation androtation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes thatno object mesh models are available during either training or test time.Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize theresidual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image.In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinementfor iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes ofrays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complexreal-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimatingthe camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional trainingdata for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform category-level object poseestimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGBimages by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.},

In this work,we develop a hybrid neural surface representation that allows us to imposegeometry-aware sampling and regularization, which significantly improves thefidelity of reconstructions. We propose to use \emph{iso-points} as an explicitrepresentation for a neural implicit function. These points are computed andupdated on-the-fly during training to capture important geometric features andimpose geometric constraints on the optimization. We demonstrate that ourmethod can be adopted to improve state-of-the-art techniques for reconstructingneural implicit surfaces from multi-view images or point clouds.

While NeRFs synthesize realistic pictures, they only model static scenesand are closely tied to specific imaging conditions. This property makes NeRFshard to generalize to new scenarios, including new lighting or new arrangementsof objects. Instead of learning a scene radiance field as a NeRF does, wepropose to learn object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs), arepresentation that models per-object light transport implicitly using alighting- and view-dependent neural network. This enables rendering scenes evenwhen objects or lights move, without retraining. Combined with a volumetricpath tracing procedure, our framework is capable of rendering both intra- andinter-object light transport effects including occlusions, specularities,shadows, and indirect illumination. We evaluate our approach on scenecomposition and show that it generalizes to novel illumination conditions,producing photorealistic, physically accurate renderings of multi-objectscenes.},

Since thecoordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in arbitrary resolution.

Thelearned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution evenextrapolate to x30 higher resolution, where the training tasks are notprovided.

Differentiable volume rendering isemployed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upperbody as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2Dsupervision.

Unfortunately, these methods lose all their predictivepower once any object in the scene has moved. In this work, we explicitly modelrigid motion of objects in the context of neural representations of radiancefields. We show that without any additional human specified supervision, we canreconstruct a dynamic scene with a single rigid object in motion bysimultaneously decomposing it into its two constituent parts and encoding eachwith its own neural representation. We achieve this by jointly optimizing theparameters of two neural radiance fields and a set of rigid poses which alignthe two fields at each frame.

  ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the challenge of novel view synthesis for a humanperformer from a very sparse set of camera views. Some recent works have shownthat learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkableview synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representationlearning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve thisill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames.To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation whichassumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share thesame set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that theobservations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable meshalso provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representationsmore efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we create a multi-view datasetnamed ZJU-MoCap that captures performers with complex motions. Experiments onZJU-MoCap show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin interms of novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability ofour approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on thePeople-Snapshot dataset.

However, NeTF measures the transient over sphericalwavefronts rather than the radiance along lines. We therefore formulate aspherical volume NeTF reconstruction pipeline, applicable to both confocal andnon-confocal setups. Compared with NeRF, NeTF samples a much sparser set ofviewpoints (scanning spots) and the sampling is highly uneven. We thusintroduce a Monte Carlo technique to improve the robustness in thereconstruction.

  ABSTRACT = {Acquisition and rendering of photo-realistic human heads is a highlychallenging research problem of particular importance for virtual telepresence.Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained ina person specific manner on multi-view data. These models better represent finestructure, such as hair, compared to simpler mesh-based models. Volumetricmodels typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, suchthat they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While sucharchitectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily beextended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novelapproach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a smallnumber of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novelparameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-alignedfeatures extracted directly from the inputs, thus sidestepping the need forvery deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end mannersolely based on a photometric re-rendering loss without requiring explicit 3Dsupervision.We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state ofthe art in terms of quality and is able to generate faithful facial expressionsin a multi-identity setting.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) are emerging as an effectiverepresentation for 3D shapes. State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDFwith a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes withimplicit surfaces. Rendering with these large networks is, however,computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through thenetwork for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-timegraphics. We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the firsttime, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achievingstate-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicitsurfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes withmultiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDFinterpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render ournovel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessaryLODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared toprevious works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstructionquality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.},

  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {While deep learning has reshaped the classical motion capture pipeline,generative, analysis-by-synthesis elements are still in use to recover finedetails if a high-quality 3D model of the user is available. Unfortunately,obtaining such a model for every user a priori is challenging, time-consuming,and limits the application scenarios. We propose a novel test-time optimizationapproach for monocular motion capture that learns a volumetric body model ofthe user in a self-supervised manner. To this end, our approach combines theadvantages of neural radiance fields with an articulated skeletonrepresentation. Our proposed skeleton embedding serves as a common referencethat links constraints across time, thereby reducing the number of requiredcamera views from traditionally dozens of calibrated cameras, down to a singleuncalibrated one. As a starting point, we employ the output of an off-the-shelfmodel that predicts the 3D skeleton pose. The volumetric body shape andappearance is then learned from scratch, while jointly refining the initialpose estimate. Our approach is self-supervised and does not require anyadditional ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape. Wedemonstrate that our novel combination of a discriminative pose estimationtechnique with surface-free analysis-by-synthesis outperforms purelydiscriminative monocular pose estimation approaches and generalizes well tomultiple views.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper tackles the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from 2D imageswithout known camera poses and intrinsics. Among various NVS techniques, NeuralRadiance Field (NeRF) has recently gained popularity due to its remarkablesynthesis quality. Existing NeRF-based approaches assume that the cameraparameters associated with each input image are either directly accessible attraining, or can be accurately estimated with conventional techniques based oncorrespondences, such as Structure-from-Motion. In this work, we propose anend-to-end framework, termed NeRF--, for training NeRF models given only RGBimages, without pre-computed camera parameters. Specifically, we show that thecamera parameters, including both intrinsics and extrinsics, can beautomatically discovered via joint optimisation during the training of the NeRFmodel. On the standard LLFF benchmark, our model achieves comparable novel viewsynthesis results compared to the baseline trained with COLMAP pre-computedcamera parameters. We also conduct extensive analyses to understand the modelbehaviour under different camera trajectories, and show that in scenarios whereCOLMAP fails, our model still produces robust results.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a method for estimating neural scenes representations of objectsgiven only a single image. The core of our method is the estimation of ageometric scaffold for the object and its use as a guide for the reconstructionof the underlying radiance field. Our formulation is based on a generativeprocess that first maps a latent code to a voxelized shape, and then renders itto an image, with the object appearance being controlled by a second latentcode. During inference, we optimize both the latent codes and the networks tofit a test image of a new object. The explicit disentanglement of shape andappearance allows our model to be fine-tuned given a single image. We can thenrender new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they representfaithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize toimages outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings and even realphotographs). Finally, the inferred geometric scaffold is itself an accurateestimate of the object's 3D shape. We demonstrate in several experiments theeffectiveness of our approach in both synthetic and real images.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in implicit neural representations show great promise when itcomes to generating numerical solutions to partial differential equations(PDEs). Compared to conventional alternatives, such representations employparameterized neural networks to define, in a mesh-free manner, signals thatare highly-detailed, continuous, and fully differentiable. Most prior works aimto exploit these benefits in order to solve PDE-governed forward problems, orassociated inverse problems that are defined by a small number of parameters.In this work, we present a novel machine learning approach to tackle topologyoptimization (TO) problems. Topology optimization refers to an important classof inverse problems that typically feature very high-dimensional parameterspaces and objective landscapes which are highly non-linear. To effectivelyleverage neural representations in the context of TO problems, we usemultilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize both density and displacementfields. Using sensitivity analysis with a moving mean squared error, we showthat our formulation can be used to efficiently minimize traditional structuralcompliance objectives. As we show through our experiments, a major benefit ofour approach is that it enables self-supervised learning of continuous solutionspaces to topology optimization problems.},

By drawing on source views at render time, ourmethod hearkens back to classic work on image-based rendering (IBR), and allowsus to render high-resolution imagery. Unlike neural scene representation workthat optimizes per-scene functions for rendering, we learn a generic viewinterpolation function that generalizes to novel scenes. We render images usingclassic volume rendering, which is fully differentiable and allows us to trainusing only multi-view posed images as supervision. Experiments show that ourmethod outperforms recent novel view synthesis methods that also seek togeneralize to novel scenes.

We achieve this by introducing a 3D-to-2Dtexture mapping (or surface parameterization) network into volumetricrepresentations. We constrain this texture mapping network using an additional2D-to-3D inverse mapping network and a novel cycle consistency loss to make 3Dsurface points map to 2D texture points that map back to the original 3Dpoints. We demonstrate that this representation can be reconstructed using onlymulti-view image supervision and generates high-quality rendering results.

  ABSTRACT = {Real-time rendering and animation of humans is a core function in games,movies, and telepresence applications. Existing methods have a number ofdrawbacks we aim to address with our work. Triangle meshes have difficultymodeling thin structures like hair, volumetric representations like NeuralVolumes are too low-resolution given a reasonable memory budget, andhigh-resolution implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields are tooslow for use in real-time applications. We present Mixture of VolumetricPrimitives (MVP), a representation for rendering dynamic 3D content thatcombines the completeness of volumetric representations with the efficiency ofprimitive-based rendering, e.g., point-based or mesh-based methods. Ourapproach achieves this by leveraging spatially shared computation with adeconvolutional architecture and by minimizing computation in empty regions ofspace with volumetric primitives that can move to cover only occupied regions.Our parameterization supports the integration of correspondence and trackingconstraints, while being robust to areas where classical tracking fails, suchas around thin or translucent structures and areas with large topologicalvariability. MVP is a hybrid that generalizes both volumetric andprimitive-based representations. Through a series of extensive experiments wedemonstrate that it inherits the strengths of each, while avoiding many oftheir limitations. We also compare our approach to several state-of-the-artmethods and demonstrate that MVP produces superior results in terms of qualityand runtime performance.},

Atthe core of our approach is a novel time-conditioned neural radiance fieldsthat represents scene dynamics using a set of compact latent codes.

  ABSTRACT = {The recent research explosion around implicit neural representations, such asNeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-qualityscene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one majorlimitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications isthe prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along eachview ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neuralrepresentations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-timeapplications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number ofsamples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samplesare placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. Tothis end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locationsfor each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using aclassification network around logarithmically discretized and sphericallywarped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather thandirectly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first stepand a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, wereduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning onavailable ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent accelerationmethods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not requireadditional memory for explicit caching or acceleration structures, and canrender interactively (20 frames per second) on a single GPU.},

Our method is completely different from existingmethods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D facemodels to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically,the feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicitfunction to generate a dynamic neural radiance field, from which ahigh-fidelity talking-head video corresponding to the audio signal issynthesized using volume rendering. Another advantage of our framework is thatnot only the head (with hair) region is synthesized as previous methods did,but also the upper body is generated via two individual neural radiance fields.Experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) producehigh-fidelity and natural results, and (2) support free adjustment of audiosignals, viewing directions, and background images.

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a method to render Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in real timeusing PlenOctrees, an octree-based 3D representation which supportsview-dependent effects. Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so withoutsacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to performfree-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependenteffects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into aPlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a sphericalharmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an inputto the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directlyoptimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal orbetter quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octreeoptimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer needto wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural renderingapproach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial andproduct visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems. PlenOctreesare amenable to in-browser rendering as well; please visit the project page forthe interactive online demo, as well as video and code:https://alexyu.net/plenoctrees},

  ABSTRACT = {NeRF synthesizes novel views of a scene with unprecedented quality by fittinga neural radiance field to RGB images. However, NeRF requires querying a deepMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP) millions of times, leading to slow renderingtimes, even on modern GPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate that real-timerendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one singlelarge MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts ofthe scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combiningthis divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering isaccelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF modelwithout incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-studentdistillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved withoutsacrificing visual quality.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural volumetric representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) haveemerged as a compelling technique for learning to represent 3D scenes fromimages with the goal of rendering photorealistic images of the scene fromunobserved viewpoints. However, NeRF's computational requirements areprohibitive for real-time applications: rendering views from a trained NeRFrequires querying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hundreds of times per ray. Wepresent a method to train a NeRF, then precompute and store (i.e. "bake") it asa novel representation called a Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) thatenables real-time rendering on commodity hardware. To achieve this, weintroduce 1) a reformulation of NeRF's architecture, and 2) a sparse voxel gridrepresentation with learned feature vectors. The resulting scene representationretains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependentappearance, is compact (averaging less than 90 MB per scene), and can berendered in real-time (higher than 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU).Actual screen captures are shown in our video.},

Recent implicit neural reconstructiontechniques are appealing as they do not require prior training data, but thesame fully self-supervised approach is not possible for semantics becauselabels are human-defined properties.We extend neural radiance fields (NeRF) to jointly encode semantics withappearance and geometry, so that complete and accurate 2D semantic labels canbe achieved using a small amount of in-place annotations specific to the scene.The intrinsic multi-view consistency and smoothness of NeRF benefit semanticsby enabling sparse labels to efficiently propagate. We show the benefit of thisapproach when labels are either sparse or very noisy in room-scale scenes. Wedemonstrate its advantageous properties in various interesting applicationssuch as an efficient scene labelling tool, novel semantic view synthesis, labeldenoising, super-resolution, label interpolation and multi-view semantic labelfusion in visual semantic mapping systems.},

Ourapproach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo)for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically basedvolume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our networkon real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets toevaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalizeacross scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our trainingscenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using onlythree input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works ongeneralizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images arecaptured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned;this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality andsubstantially less optimization time than NeRF.},

However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera posesestimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera posesin roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories andrequire rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizesrandomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a noveltwo-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into thenew realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, whilethe second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcomelocal minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensiveexperiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate theeffectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms thebaselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low texturesthat are regarded as extremely challenging before.},

  ABSTRACT = {Traditional high-quality 3D graphics requires large volumes of fine-detailedscene data for rendering. This demand compromises computational efficiency andlocal storage resources. Specifically, it becomes more concerning for futurewearable and portable virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays. Recentapproaches to combat this problem include remote rendering/streaming and neuralrepresentations of 3D assets. These approaches have redefined the traditionallocal storage-rendering pipeline by distributed computing or compression oflarge data. However, these methods typically suffer from high latency or lowquality for practical visualization of large immersive virtual scenes, notablywith extra high resolution and refresh rate requirements for VR applicationssuch as gaming and design.Tailored for the future portable, low-storage, and energy-efficient VRplatforms, we present the first gaze-contingent 3D neural representation andview synthesis method. We incorporate the human psychophysics of visual- andstereo-acuity into an egocentric neural representation of 3D scenery.Furthermore, we jointly optimize the latency/performance and visual quality,while mutually bridging human perception and neural scene synthesis, to achieveperceptually high-quality immersive interaction. Both objective analysis andsubjective study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in significantlyreducing local storage volume and synthesis latency (up to 99% reduction inboth data size and computational time), while simultaneously presentinghigh-fidelity rendering, with perceptual quality identical to that of fullylocally stored and rendered high-quality imagery.},

  ABSTRACT = {Tremendous progress in deep generative models has led to photorealistic imagesynthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in thetwo-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of ourworld. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably tothe image plane. This leads to impressive 3D consistency, but incorporatingsuch a bias comes at a price: the camera needs to be modeled as well. Currentapproaches assume fixed intrinsics and a predefined prior over camera poseranges. As a result, parameter tuning is typically required for real-worlddata, and results degrade if the data distribution is not matched. Our keyhypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generatorleads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, wepropose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leadingto more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training fromraw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generativemodel which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera datadistribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit controlover the camera as well as the shape and appearance of the scene.},

  ABSTRACT = {Parametric 3D models have enabled a wide variety of tasks in computergraphics and vision, such as modeling human bodies, faces, and hands. However,the construction of these parametric models is often tedious, as it requiresheavy manual tweaking, and they struggle to represent additional complexity anddetails such as wrinkles or clothing. To this end, we propose Neural ParametricModels (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3Dmodels, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints. Inparticular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-spacerepresentations of shape and pose, leveraging the flexibility of recentdevelopments in learned implicit functions. Crucially, once learned, our neuralparametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spacesto fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametricmodel, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurateand detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMsimprove notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art inreconstruction and tracking of monocular depth sequences of clothed humans andhands. Latent-space interpolation as well as shape/pose transfer experimentsfurther demonstrate the usefulness of NPMs. Code is publicly available athttps://pablopalafox.github.io/npms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Majority of the perception methods in robotics require depth informationprovided by RGB-D cameras. However, standard 3D sensors fail to capture depthof transparent objects due to refraction and absorption of light.

Key to our approach is a local implicit neuralrepresentation built on ray-voxel pairs that allows our method to generalize tounseen objects and achieve fast inference speed. Based on this representation,we present a novel framework that can complete missing depth given noisy RGB-Dinput. We further improve the depth estimation iteratively using aself-correcting refinement model. To train the whole pipeline, we build a largescale synthetic dataset with transparent objects. Experiments demonstrate thatour method performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-artmethods on both synthetic and real world data. In addition, our approachimproves the inference speed by a factor of 20 compared to the previous bestmethod, ClearGrasp.

Recent work has shown that generative models of radiance fieldscan capture properties such as multi-view consistency and view-dependentlighting. However, these models are specialized for constrained viewing ofsingle objects, such as cars or faces. Due to the size and complexity ofrealistic indoor environments, existing models lack the representationalcapacity to adequately capture them. Our decomposition scheme scales to largerand more complex scenes while preserving details and diversity, and the learnedprior enables high-quality rendering from viewpoints that are significantlydifferent from observed viewpoints.

To improvefew-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semanticconsistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRFis trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views fromthe same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different,random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitraryposes. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such asCLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diversesingle-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural languagesupervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality offew-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views withas few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, andproduces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Getting representations of multiple objects or scenes is a raising research topic in Machine Learning (ML) community. Here, we propose a multi-scene representation model that can learn the representation of complex scenes and reconstruct them in high resolution given novel viewing directions. Our method represents a single scene with fully-connected layers. Each set of fully-connected layers are controlled by hyper-networks for multiple scenes modeling. For each scene, we take 3D coordinates (x, y, z) and 2D view-point orientations (I,, E,) as inputs. A set of fully-connected layers output volume density and RGB values at given 3D spatial positions. Then, we render the output volume density and RGB values along the camera rays into images using volume density rendering techniques. During training process, we optimize a continuous volume scene function with a small amount of input viewing directions. By designing versatile embedding module and multi-scene representation networks, our model can render photographic images with novel viewing directions for different complex scenes. Experiment results demonstrate the neural rendering and multi-scene representation abilities of our model. Several thorough experiments show that our method outperforms previous model on both reconstruction precision and scenes generation ability from novel viewing directions.}

We make learning more computationallyefficient by deriving a novel loss, which allows training NeRFs on RGB-D inputswithout explicit ray marching. After confirming that the model performs equalor better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, weapply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and anovel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find thatafter training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of notonly recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image,but also to segment it into objects, despite receiving no supervision in thatregard.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have witnessed rapid progress on 3D-aware image synthesis, leveragingrecent advances in generative visual models and neural rendering. Existingapproaches however fall short in two ways: first, they may lack an underlying3D representation or rely on view-inconsistent rendering, hence synthesizingimages that are not multi-view consistent; second, they often depend uponrepresentation network architectures that are not expressive enough, and theirresults thus lack in image quality. We propose a novel generative model, namedPeriodic Implicit Generative Adversarial Networks ($\pi$-GAN or pi-GAN), forhigh-quality 3D-aware image synthesis. $\pi$-GAN leverages neuralrepresentations with periodic activation functions and volumetric rendering torepresent scenes as view-consistent 3D representations with fine detail. Theproposed approach obtains state-of-the-art results for 3D-aware image synthesiswith multiple real and synthetic datasets.},

More specifically, we propose anefficient sampling strategy along with both the camera rays and image plane,which enables efficient radiance field sampling and learning in a patch-wisemanner, as well as a novel volumetric feature integration scheme that generatesper-patch hybrid feature embeddings to reconstruct the view-consistentfine-detailed appearance and opacity output. We further adopt a patch-wiseadversarial training scheme to preserve both high-frequency appearance andopacity details in a self-supervised framework. We also introduce an effectivemulti-view image capture system to capture high-quality color and alpha mapsfor challenging fuzzy objects. Extensive experiments on existing and our newchallenging fuzzy object dataset demonstrate that our method achievesphoto-realistic, globally consistent, and fined detailed appearance and opacityfree-viewpoint rendering for various fuzzy objects.},

  ABSTRACT = {Photo-realistic neural reconstruction and rendering of the human portrait arecritical for numerous VR/AR applications. Still, existing solutions inherentlyrely on multi-view capture settings, and the one-shot solution to get rid ofthe tedious multi-view synchronization and calibration remains extremelychallenging. In this paper, we propose MirrorNeRF - a one-shot neural portraitfree-viewpoint rendering approach using a catadioptric imaging system withmultiple sphere mirrors and a single high-resolution digital camera, which isthe first to combine neural radiance field with catadioptric imaging so as toenable one-shot photo-realistic human portrait reconstruction and rendering, ina low-cost and casual capture setting. More specifically, we propose alight-weight catadioptric system design with a sphere mirror array to enablediverse ray sampling in the continuous 3D space as well as an effective onlinecalibration for the camera and the mirror array. Our catadioptric imagingsystem can be easily deployed with a low budget and the casual capture abilityfor convenient daily usages. We introduce a novel neural warping radiance fieldrepresentation to learn a continuous displacement field that implicitlycompensates for the misalignment due to our flexible system setting. We furtherpropose a density regularization scheme to leverage the inherent geometryinformation from the catadioptric data in a self-supervision manner, which notonly improves the training efficiency but also provides more effective densitysupervision for higher rendering quality.

  ABSTRACT = {We present Neural Articulated Radiance Field (NARF), a novel deformable 3Drepresentation for articulated objects learned from images. While recentadvances in 3D implicit representation have made it possible to learn models ofcomplex objects, learning pose-controllable representations of articulatedobjects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervisionand are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representationof 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformationof the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3Dlocation. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changeswithout significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fullydifferentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover,through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations overmultiple instances of an object class. Experiments show that the proposedmethod is efficient and can generalize well to novel poses. The code isavailable for research purposes at https://github.com/nogu-atsu/NARF},

  ABSTRACT = {We present SCANimate, an end-to-end trainable framework that takes raw 3Dscans of a clothed human and turns them into an animatable avatar. Theseavatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that movesand deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template orsurface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model,like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration ofthe body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviatesignificantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulatedtransformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle consistency in theposed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervisedlearning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentanglingarticulated deformations without template-based surface registration.Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modelingpose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicitfunction that learns to complete and model geometry with learned posecorrectives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our localpose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations andimproves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data islimited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling togenerate a fully textured avatar. We demonstrate our approach on variousclothing types with different amounts of training data, outperforming existingsolutions and other variants in terms of fidelity and generality in everysetting.

  ABSTRACT = {Neural implicit surface representations have emerged as a promising paradigmto capture 3D shapes in a continuous and resolution-independent manner.However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existingapproaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points.However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependentand thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduceSNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) forpolygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forwarddeformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is definedin canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseenposes. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challengingsince the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may notbe unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model thatfinds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative rootfinding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enablingend-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared tostate-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizesbetter to unseen poses while preserving accuracy.

  ABSTRACT = {Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) make powerful functional representations forsampling and reconstruction problems involving low-dimensional signals likeimages,shapes and light fields. Recent works have significantly improved theirability to represent high-frequency content by using periodic activations orpositional encodings. This often came at the expense of generalization: modernmethods are typically optimized for a single signal. We present a newrepresentation that generalizes to multiple instances and achievesstate-of-the-art fidelity. We use a dual-MLP architecture to encode thesignals. A synthesis network creates a functional mapping from alow-dimensional input (e.g. pixel-position) to the output domain (e.g. RGBcolor). A modulation network maps a latent code corresponding to the targetsignal to parameters that modulate the periodic activations of the synthesisnetwork. We also propose a local-functional representation which enablesgeneralization. The signal's domain is partitioned into a regular grid,witheach tile represented by a latent code. At test time, the signal is encodedwith high-fidelity by inferring (or directly optimizing) the latent code-book.Our approach produces generalizable functional representations of images,videos and shapes, and achieves higher reconstruction quality than prior worksthat are optimized for a single signal.},

Wedemonstrate how depth measurements can be incorporated into the radiance fieldformulation to produce more detailed and complete reconstruction results thanusing methods based on either color or depth data alone. In contrast to adensity field as the underlying geometry representation, we propose to learn adeep neural network which stores a truncated signed distance field. Using thisrepresentation, we show that one can still leverage differentiable volumerendering to estimate color values of the observed images during training tocompute a reconstruction loss. This is beneficial for learning the signeddistance field in regions with missing depth measurements. Furthermore, wecorrect misalignment errors of the camera, improving the overall reconstructionquality.

  ABSTRACT = {Recent neural view synthesis methods have achieved impressive quality andrealism, surpassing classical pipelines which rely on multi-viewreconstruction. State-of-the-Art methods, such as NeRF, are designed to learn asingle scene with a neural network and require dense multi-view inputs. Testingon a new scene requires re-training from scratch, which takes 2-3 days. In thiswork, we introduce Stereo Radiance Fields (SRF), a neural view synthesisapproach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requiresonly sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspiredby classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points byfinding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color anddensity for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in theinput images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wisesimilarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learnsstructure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of theDTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10sparse and spread-out views as input. We show that 10-15 minutes of fine-tuningfurther improve the results, achieving significantly sharper, more detailedresults than scene-specific models.

For each scene, we train S-NeRF using very highspatial resolution optical images taken from known viewing angles. The learningrequires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an imagereconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions bothfrom a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky),we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from theSun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirectillumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color fieldas a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination ofthese factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, comparedto NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, andtransient object filtering, without any explicit shape supervision.},

  ABSTRACT = {Reconstructing dynamic, time-varying scenes with computed tomography (4D-CT)is a challenging and ill-posed problem common to industrial and medicalsettings. Existing 4D-CT reconstructions are designed for sparse samplingschemes that require fast CT scanners to capture multiple, rapid revolutionsaround the scene in order to generate high quality results. However, if thescene is moving too fast, then the sampling occurs along a limited view and isdifficult to reconstruct due to spatiotemporal ambiguities. In this work, wedesign a reconstruction pipeline using implicit neural representations coupledwith a novel parametric motion field warping to perform limited view 4D-CTreconstruction of rapidly deforming scenes. Importantly, we utilize adifferentiable analysis-by-synthesis approach to compare with captured x-raysinogram data in a self-supervised fashion. Thus, our resulting optimizationmethod requires no training data to reconstruct the scene.

  ABSTRACT = {Invariance and equivariance to the rotation group have been widely discussedin the 3D deep learning community for pointclouds. Yet most proposed methodseither use complex mathematical tools that may limit their accessibility, orare tied to specific input data types and network architectures. In this paper,we introduce a general framework built on top of what we call Vector Neuronrepresentations for creating SO(3)-equivariant neural networks for pointcloudprocessing. Extending neurons from 1D scalars to 3D vectors, our vector neuronsenable a simple mapping of SO(3) actions to latent spaces thereby providing aframework for building equivariance in common neural operations -- includinglinear layers, non-linearities, pooling, and normalizations. Due to theirsimplicity, vector neurons are versatile and, as we demonstrate, can beincorporated into diverse network architecture backbones, allowing them toprocess geometry inputs in arbitrary poses. Despite its simplicity, our methodperforms comparably well in accuracy and generalization with other more complexand specialized state-of-the-art methods on classification and segmentationtasks. We also show for the first time a rotation equivariant reconstructionnetwork.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent neural rendering methods have demonstrated accurate view interpolationby predicting volumetric density and color with a neural network. Although suchvolumetric representations can be supervised on static and dynamic scenes,existing methods implicitly bake the complete scene light transport into asingle neural network for a given scene, including surface modeling,bidirectional scattering distribution functions, and indirect lighting effects.In contrast to traditional rendering pipelines, this prohibits changing surfacereflectance, illumination, or composing other objects in the scene.In this work, we explicitly model the light transport between scene surfacesand we rely on traditional integration schemes and the rendering equation toreconstruct a scene. The proposed method allows BSDF recovery with unknownlight conditions and classic light transports such as pathtracing. By learningdecomposed transport with surface representations established in conventionalrendering methods, the method naturally facilitates editing shape, reflectance,lighting and scene composition. The method outperforms NeRV for relightingunder known lighting conditions, and produces realistic reconstructions forrelit and edited scenes. We validate the proposed approach for scene editing,relighting and reflectance estimation learned from synthetic and captured viewson a subset of NeRV's datasets.},

  ABSTRACT = {Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experiencebut recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate thevisual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper wepropose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint videogeneration for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. Thecore of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamicentity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-timecoherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layeredrepresentation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of thedynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a widerange. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuousfunctions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as wellas the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervisedmanner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle thespatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentanglethe temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme isfurther introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt anovel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficienttraining for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our frameworkfurther enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scaleand location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to createnumerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality,photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamicscenes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Some forms of novel visual media enable the viewer to explore a 3D scene fromarbitrary viewpoints, by interpolating between a discrete set of originalviews. Compared to 2D imagery, these types of applications require much largeramounts of storage space, which we seek to reduce. Existing approaches forcompressing 3D scenes are based on a separation of compression and rendering:each of the original views is compressed using traditional 2D image formats;the receiver decompresses the views and then performs the rendering. We unifythese steps by directly compressing an implicit representation of the scene, afunction that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field, which canthen be queried to render arbitrary viewpoints. The function is implemented asa neural network and jointly trained for reconstruction as well ascompressibility, in an end-to-end manner, with the use of an entropy penalty onthe parameters. Our method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-artconventional approach for scene compression, achieving simultaneously higherquality reconstructions and lower bitrates. Furthermore, we show that theperformance at lower bitrates can be improved by jointly representing multiplescenes using a soft form of parameter sharing.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable humanmodel from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose adynamic scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformationfields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, therebyenabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they representthe deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makesthe optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representationscannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neuralblend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on theskeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D humanskeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observationcorrespondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they canregularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blendweight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate newdeformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that ourapproach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods. The codewill be available at https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural representations have emerged as a new paradigm for applications inrendering, imaging, geometric modeling, and simulation. Compared to traditionalrepresentations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexiblyincorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recentimprovements to neural representations now make it possible to representsignals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3Dshapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven achallenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent imagesat resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a fewhundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicitnetwork architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resourcesduring training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal ofinterest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition,similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The networkarchitecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters,a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then,hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluatedusing a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit networkarchitecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images tonearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase inscale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstratedimage-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3Dshapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reducestraining times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over anorder of magnitude.},

  ABSTRACT = {Rendering 3D scenes requires access to arbitrary viewpoints from the scene.Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images takenfrom the 3D scene that can reconstruct the scene back through interpolations,or (2) storing a representation of the 3D scene itself that already encodesviews from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods havefocused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images withimage compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes thestored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separatedprocedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored.In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functionalrepresentation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes asneural radiance fields. Our method provides more efficient storage of 3D scenessince it does not store 2D images -- which are redundant when we render thescene from the neural functional representation.},

In this paper,we compare and evaluate the potential of NeRF and GRAF to render novel viewsand extract the 3D shape of two different spacecraft, the Soil Moisture andOcean Salinity satellite of ESA's Living Planet Programme and a generic cubesat. Considering the best performances of both models, we observe that NeRF hasthe ability to render more accurate images regarding the material specularityof the spacecraft and its pose. For its part, GRAF generates precise novelviews with accurate details even when parts of the satellites are shadowedwhile having the significant advantage of not needing any information about therelative pose.},

  ABSTRACT = {Multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) provides clinical information ofheartbeats from several fixed viewpoints determined by the lead positioning.However, it is often not satisfactory to visualize ECG signals in these fixedand limited views, as some clinically useful information is represented onlyfrom a few specific ECG viewpoints. For the first time, we propose a newconcept, Electrocardio Panorama, which allows visualizing ECG signals from anyqueried viewpoints. To build Electrocardio Panorama, we assume that anunderlying electrocardio field exists, representing locations, magnitudes, anddirections of ECG signals. We present a Neural electrocardio field Network(Nef-Net), which first predicts the electrocardio field representation by usinga sparse set of one or few input ECG views and then synthesizes ElectrocardioPanorama based on the predicted representations. Specially, to betterdisentangle electrocardio field information from viewpoint biases, a newAngular Encoding is proposed to process viewpoint angles. Also, we propose aself-supervised learning approach called Standin Learning, which helps modelthe electrocardio field without direct supervision. Further, with very fewmodifications, Nef-Net can also synthesize ECG signals from scratch.Experiments verify that our Nef-Net performs well on Electrocardio Panoramasynthesis, and outperforms the previous work on the auxiliary tasks (ECG viewtransformation and ECG synthesis from scratch).

First, we propose a conditional radiance field that incorporates newmodular network components, including a shape branch that is shared acrossobject instances. Observing multiple instances of the same category, our modellearns underlying part semantics without any supervision, thereby allowing thepropagation of coarse 2D user scribbles to the entire 3D region (e.g., chairseat). Next, we propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets specificnetwork components, which balances efficiency and accuracy. During userinteraction, we formulate an optimization problem that both satisfies theuser's constraints and preserves the original object structure. We demonstrateour approach on various editing tasks over three shape datasets and show thatit outperforms prior neural editing approaches.

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present an efficient and robust deep learning solution fornovel view synthesis of complex scenes.

For efficient novel viewrendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray ischaracterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4Dfunction that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train adeep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorizethe 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.Different from previous light field approaches which require dense viewsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views bysampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of trainingimages.

  ABSTRACT = {View synthesis methods using implicit continuous shape representationslearned from a set of images, such as the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) method,have gained increasing attention due to their high quality imagery andscalability to high resolution. However, the heavy computation required by itsvolumetric approach prevents NeRF from being useful in practice; minutes aretaken to render a single image of a few megapixels. Now, an image of a scenecan be rendered in a level-of-detail manner, so we posit that a complicatedregion of the scene should be represented by a large neural network while asmall neural network is capable of encoding a simple region, enabling a balancebetween efficiency and quality. Recursive-NeRF is our embodiment of this idea,providing an efficient and adaptive rendering and training approach for NeRF.The core of Recursive-NeRF learns uncertainties for query coordinates,representing the quality of the predicted color and volumetric intensity ateach level. Only query coordinates with high uncertainties are forwarded to thenext level to a bigger neural network with a more powerful representationalcapability. The final rendered image is a composition of results from neuralnetworks of all levels.

Inspired by the high quality results of the neural radiance fields(NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views withthe desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicitrepresentation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance field model, and ahypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.In particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene intothe geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predictthe parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. Toalleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stagetraining procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style andcontent losses with the neural radiance field model. After optimization, ourmodel is able to render consistent novel views at arbitrary view angles witharbitrary style.

This enables the rendering of novel views ofthe object under arbitrary environment lighting and editing of the object'smaterial properties. The key to our approach, which we call Neural RadianceFactorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric geometry of a NeuralRadiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] representation of the objectinto a surface representation and then jointly refine the geometry whilesolving for the spatially-varying reflectance and the environment lighting.Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of surface normals, lightvisibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions(BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a re-rendering loss, simplesmoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior learned from real-world BRDFmeasurements. By explicitly modeling light visibility, NeRFactor is able toseparate shadows from albedo and synthesize realistic soft or hard shadowsunder arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor is able to recover convincing 3Dmodels for free-viewpoint relighting in this challenging and underconstrainedcapture setup for both synthetic and real scenes.

In this paper, we propose a novelpositional encoding scheme, called Spline Positional Encoding, to map the inputcoordinates to a high dimensional space before passing them to MLPs, forhelping to recover 3D signed distance fields with fine-scale geometric detailsfrom unorganized 3D point clouds. We verified the superiority of our approachover other positional encoding schemes on tasks of 3D shape reconstruction frominput point clouds and shape space learning. The efficacy of our approachextended to image reconstruction is also demonstrated and evaluated.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis ofhumans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Ourmethod is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering workswhich learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images.While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes andplayback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering ofhumans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novelposes, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse bodymodel as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. Aneural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-viewvideo input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry andappearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latentvariables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance.Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than thestate-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can evengeneralize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesizedresults.},

  ABSTRACT = {Inferring representations of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamentalproblem of computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.Emerging 3D-structured neural scene representations are a promising approach to3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose a novel neural scenerepresentation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry andappearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional lightfield parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray froman LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds ofevaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, weleverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-viewconsistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single imageobservation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity,and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light fieldvia an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such asthe Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicitrepresentations and a novel parameterization of light space, we furtherdemonstrate the extraction of sparse depth maps from LFNs.},

  ABSTRACT = {Implicit representations of geometry, such as occupancy fields or signeddistance fields (SDF), have recently re-gained popularity in encoding 3D solidshape in a functional form. In this work, we introduce medial fields: a fieldfunction derived from the medial axis transform (MAT) that makes availableinformation about the underlying 3D geometry that is immediately useful for anumber of downstream tasks. In particular, the medial field encodes the localthickness of a 3D shape, and enables O(1) projection of a query point onto themedial axis. To construct the medial field we require nothing but the SDF ofthe shape itself, thus allowing its straightforward incorporation in anyapplication that relies on signed distance fields. Working in unison with theO(1) surface projection supported by the SDF, the medial field opens the doorfor an entirely new set of efficient, shape-aware operations on implicitrepresentations. We present three such applications, including a modificationto sphere tracing that renders implicit representations with better convergenceproperties, a fast construction method for memory-efficient rigid-bodycollision proxies, and an efficient approximation of ambient occlusion thatremains stable with respect to viewpoint variations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Synthesizing novel views of dynamic humans from stationary monocular camerasis a popular scenario. This is particularly attractive as it does not requirestatic scenes, controlled environments, or specialized hardware. In contrast totechniques that exploit multi-view observations to constrain the modeling,given a single fixed viewpoint only, the problem of modeling the dynamic sceneis significantly more under-constrained and ill-posed. In this paper, weintroduce Neural Motion Consensus Flow (MoCo-Flow), a representation thatmodels the dynamic scene using a 4D continuous time-variant function. Theproposed representation is learned by an optimization which models a dynamicscene that minimizes the error of rendering all observation images. At theheart of our work lies a novel optimization formulation, which is constrainedby a motion consensus regularization on the motion flow. We extensivelyevaluate MoCo-Flow on several datasets that contain human motions of varyingcomplexity, and compare, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to severalbaseline methods and variants of our methods.

  ABSTRACT = {We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method, called NeuS, forreconstructing objects and scenes with high fidelity from 2D image inputs.Existing neural surface reconstruction approaches, such as DVR and IDR, requireforeground mask as supervision, easily get trapped in local minima, andtherefore struggle with the reconstruction of objects with severeself-occlusion or thin structures. Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novelview synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to producea neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highlycomplex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learnedimplicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surfaceconstraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surfaceas the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a newvolume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe thatthe conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation thatis free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to moreaccurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experimentson the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms thestate-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially forobjects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural volume rendering became increasingly popular recently due to itssuccess in synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of inputimages. So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques wasmodeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself wasextracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to anoisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improvegeometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. Weachieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. Thisis in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of thevolume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function asLaplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distancefunction (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has threebenefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned inthe neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacityapproximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry andradiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shapeand appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation tochallenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometryreconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shapeand appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of thetwo.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we aim to create generalizable and controllable neural signeddistance fields (SDFs) that represent clothed humans from monocular depthobservations. Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicitrepresentations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllableavatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realisticcloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-bodyscans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty ofeffectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapesand cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-typeoptimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, wepropose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars,represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. Weachieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of ahypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork isconditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deformsnon-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned toeffectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thuscan be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. Wequalitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperformsstate-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while ourapproach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudesfaster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our meta-learned hypernetwork is veryrobust, being the first to generate avatars with realistic dynamic clothdeformations given as few as 8 monocular depth frames.},

Since pretraining neuralnetworks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalizationchallenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve generalization viaadaptation, i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. Weemploy self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulateinfinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. Theupdates and cache queries incur a mild overhead -- about 2.6ms on full HDresolution -- thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network thatfully exploits modern hardware. We demonstrate significant noise reduction atthe cost of little induced bias, and report state-of-the-art, real-timeperformance on a number of challenging scenarios.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes withunprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handledynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes isthrough the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in eachinput image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, thesedeformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, astopological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but thesedeformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation bylifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5Dradiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice throughthis "hyper-space". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which modelthe evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. Weevaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between "moments",i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintainingvisual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We showthat our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on bothtasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces averageerror rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, asmeasured by LPIPS.},

  ABSTRACT = {One common failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models is fittingincorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. Wepropose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learningneural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depthsupervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used toregularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively renderingnovel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines requireimages with known camera poses that are typically estimated by runningstructure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points thatcan be used as ``free" depth supervision during training: we simply add a lossto ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points isclose to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurateimages given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only twotraining views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF aswell as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible withthese NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestiblesupervisory signal. Finally, we show that DS-NeRF supports other types of depthsupervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGBD reconstruction outputs.},

  ABSTRACT = {Classic algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) for computed tomography requires pre-determined weights of the voxels for the projected pixel values to build the equations. However, such weights cannot be accurately obtained in the application of chemiluminescence measurements due to the high physical complexity and computation resources required. Moreover, streaks arise in the results from ART method especially with imperfect projections. In this study, we propose a semi-case-wise learning-based method named Weight Encode Reconstruction Network (WERNet) to co-learn the target phantom intensities and the adaptive weight matrix of the case without labeling the target voxel set and thus offers a more applicable solution for computed tomography problems. Both numerical and experimental validations were conducted to evaluate the algorithm. In the numerical test, with the help of gradient normalization, the WERNet reconstructed voxel set with a high accuracy and showed a higher capability of denoising compared to the classic ART methods. In the experimental test, WERNet produces comparable results to the ART method while having a better performance in avoiding the streaks. Furthermore, with the adaptive weight matrix, WERNet is not sensitive to the ensemble intensity of the projection which shows much better robustness than ART method.}

  ABSTRACT = {We study the problem of inferring an object-centric scene representation froma single image, aiming to derive a representation that explains the imageformation process, captures the scene's 3D nature, and is learned withoutsupervision. Most existing methods on scene decomposition lack one or more ofthese characteristics, due to the fundamental challenge in integrating thecomplex 3D-to-2D image formation process into powerful inference schemes likedeep networks. In this paper, we propose unsupervised discovery of ObjectRadiance Fields (uORF), integrating recent progresses in neural 3D scenerepresentations and rendering with deep inference networks for unsupervised 3Dscene decomposition. Trained on multi-view RGB images without annotations, uORFlearns to decompose complex scenes with diverse, textured background from asingle image. We show that uORF performs well on unsupervised 3D scenesegmentation, novel view synthesis, and scene editing on three datasets.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neural networks that map 3D coordinates to signed distance function (SDF) oroccupancy values have enabled high-fidelity implicit representations of objectshape. This paper develops a new shape model that allows synthesizing noveldistance views by optimizing a continuous signed directional distance function(SDDF). Similar to deep SDF models, our SDDF formulation can represent wholecategories of shapes and complete or interpolate across shapes from partialinput data. Unlike an SDF, which measures distance to the nearest surface inany direction, an SDDF measures distance in a given direction. This allowstraining an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distancemeasurements, readily available from depth camera or Lidar sensors. Our modelalso removes post-processing steps like surface extraction or rendering bydirectly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions.Unlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, whichtrain high-capacity black-box models, our model encodes by construction theproperty that SDDF values decrease linearly along the viewing direction. Thisstructure constraint not only results in dimensionality reduction but alsoprovides analytical confidence about the accuracy of SDDF predictions,regardless of the distance to the object surface.},

The effectiveness of these techniquesis, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) ofinput views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In thispaper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3Dhead reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with aprobabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and bettergeneralization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn ashape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicitrepresentations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neuralnetworks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating thesurface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise atwo-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used toinitialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase.Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, weachieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, andwith a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametricmethods when large sets of views are available.},

We leverage the expression space ofa 3D morphable face model (3DMM) to represent the distribution of human facialexpressions, and use it to condition the NeRF volumetric function. Furthermore,we impose a spatial prior brought by 3DMM fitting to guide the network to learndisentangled control for scene appearance and facial actions.

Given a sequence of scans ofa subject in various poses, we learn to animate the character for new poses.Existing methods have relied on template-based representations of the humanbody (or clothing). However such models usually have fixed and limitedresolutions, require difficult data pre-processing steps and cannot be usedwith complex clothing. We draw inspiration from template-based methods, whichfactorize motion into articulation and non-rigid deformation, but generalizethis concept for implicit shape learning to obtain a more flexible model. Welearn to map every point in the space to a canonical space, where a learneddeformation field is applied to model non-rigid effects, before evaluating thesigned distance field. Our formulation allows the learning of complex andnon-rigid deformations of clothing and soft tissue, without computing atemplate registration as it is common with current approaches. Neural-GIF canbe trained on raw 3D scans and reconstructs detailed complex surface geometryand deformations. Moreover, the model can generalize to new poses. We evaluateour method on a variety of characters from different public datasets in diverseclothing styles and show significant improvements over baseline methods,quantitatively and qualitatively.

  ABSTRACT = {Implicit neural representation is a recent approach to learn shapecollections as zero level-sets of neural networks, where each shape isrepresented by a latent code. So far, the focus has been shape reconstruction,while shape generalization was mostly left to generic encoder-decoder orauto-decoder regularization.In this paper we advocate deformation-aware regularization for implicitneural representations, aiming at producing plausible deformations as latentcode changes. The challenge is that implicit representations do not capturecorrespondences between different shapes, which makes it difficult to representand regularize their deformations. Thus, we propose to pair the implicitrepresentation of the shapes with an explicit, piecewise linear deformationfield, learned as an auxiliary function. We demonstrate that, by regularizingthese deformation fields, we can encourage the implicit neural representationto induce natural deformations in the learned shape space, such asas-rigid-as-possible deformations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Robotic grasping of house-hold objects has made remarkable progress in recentyears. Yet, human grasps are still difficult to synthesize realistically. Thereare several key reasons: (1) the human hand has many degrees of freedom (morethan robotic manipulators); (2) the synthesized hand should conform to thesurface of the object; and (3) it should interact with the object in asemantically and physically plausible manner. To make progress in thisdirection, we draw inspiration from the recent progress on learning-basedimplicit representations for 3D object reconstruction. Specifically, we proposean expressive representation for human grasp modelling that is efficient andeasy to integrate with deep neural networks. Our insight is that every point ina three-dimensional space can be characterized by the signed distances to thesurface of the hand and the object, respectively. Consequently, the hand, theobject, and the contact area can be represented by implicit surfaces in acommon space, in which the proximity between the hand and the object can bemodelled explicitly. We name this 3D to 2D mapping as Grasping Field,parameterize it with a deep neural network, and learn it from data. Wedemonstrate that the proposed grasping field is an effective and expressiverepresentation for human grasp generation. Specifically, our generative modelis able to synthesize high-quality human grasps, given only on a 3D objectpoint cloud. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative modelcompares favorably with a strong baseline and approaches the level of naturalhuman grasps. Our method improves the physical plausibility of the hand-objectcontact reconstruction and achieves comparable performance for 3D handreconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Efficient representation of articulated objects such as human bodies is animportant problem in computer vision and graphics. To efficiently simulatedeformation, existing approaches represent 3D objects using polygonal meshesand deform them using skinning techniques. This paper introduces neuralarticulated shape approximation (NASA), an alternative framework that enablesefficient representation of articulated deformable objects using neuralindicator functions that are conditioned on pose. Occupancy testing using NASAis straightforward, circumventing the complexity of meshes and the issue ofwater-tightness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NASA for 3D trackingapplications, and discuss other potential extensions.},

  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {Registering point clouds of dressed humans to parametric human models is achallenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches often rely onheavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization ofhuman poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methodsare proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that poseinitialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often failto provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressingjoint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still verychallenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields(PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any querypoint in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combinePTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-basedframework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-pointcorrespondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothedhuman. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point canbe effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently,rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficientlyvia a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences,circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations fromneural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalizedoccupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability andresults in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of theparameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative andquantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initializedby our network results in much better registration quality, especially forextreme poses.},

  ABSTRACT = {Implicit functions represented as deep learning approximations are powerfulfor reconstructing 3D surfaces. However, they can only produce static surfacesthat are not controllable, which provides limited ability to modify theresulting model by editing its pose or shape parameters. Nevertheless, suchfeatures are essential in building flexible models for both computer graphicsand computer vision. In this work, we present methodology that combinesdetail-rich implicit functions and parametric representations in order toreconstruct 3D models of people that remain controllable and accurate even inthe presence of clothing. Given sparse 3D point clouds sampled on the surfaceof a dressed person, we use an Implicit Part Network (IP-Net)to jointly predictthe outer 3D surface of the dressed person, the and inner body surface, and thesemantic correspondences to a parametric body model. We subsequently usecorrespondences to fit the body model to our inner surface and then non-rigidlydeform it (under a parametric body + displacement model) to the outer surfacein order to capture garment, face and hair detail. In quantitative andqualitative experiments with both full body data and hand scans we show thatthe proposed methodology generalizes, and is effective even given incompletepoint clouds collected from single-view depth images.

  ARCHIVEPREFIX = {arXiv},
  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {We address the problem of fitting 3D human models to 3D scans of dressedhumans. Classical methods optimize both the data-to-model correspondences andthe human model parameters (pose and shape), but are reliable only wheninitialized close to the solution. Some methods initialize the optimizationbased on fully supervised correspondence predictors, which is notdifferentiable end-to-end, and can only process a single scan at a time. Ourmain contribution is LoopReg, an end-to-end learning framework to register acorpus of scans to a common 3D human model. The key idea is to create aself-supervised loop. A backward map, parameterized by a Neural Network,predicts the correspondence from every scan point to the surface of the humanmodel. A forward map, parameterized by a human model, transforms thecorresponding points back to the scan based on the model parameters (pose andshape), thus closing the loop. Formulating this closed loop is notstraightforward because it is not trivial to force the output of the NN to beon the surface of the human model - outside this surface the human model is noteven defined. To this end, we propose two key innovations. First, we define thecanonical surface implicitly as the zero level set of a distance field in R3,which in contrast to morecommon UV parameterizations, does not require cuttingthe surface, does not have discontinuities, and does not induce distortion.Second, we diffuse the human model to the 3D domain R3. This allows to map theNN predictions forward,even when they slightly deviate from the zero level set.Results demonstrate that we can train LoopRegmainly self-supervised - followinga supervised warm-start, the model becomes increasingly more accurate asadditional unlabelled raw scans are processed. Our code and pre-trained modelscan be downloaded for research.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this work, we present a new multi-view depth estimation method thatutilizes both conventional SfM reconstruction and learning-based priors overthe recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF). Unlike existing neuralnetwork based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, ourmethod directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challengingstep of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilizethe learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our systemfirstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning onits sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguityof NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue byemploying the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volumerendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation onthe rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality.Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperformsstate-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presentedon the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-basedoptimization over the adapted depth priors.

  ABSTRACT = {The recent deep learning revolution has created an enormous opportunity foraccelerating compute capabilities in the context of physics-based simulations.Here, we propose EikoNet, a deep learning approach to solving the Eikonalequation, which characterizes the first-arrival-time field in heterogeneous 3Dvelocity structures. Our grid-free approach allows for rapid determination ofthe travel time between any two points within a continuous 3D domain. Thesetravel time solutions are allowed to violate the differential equation - whichcasts the problem as one of optimization - with the goal of finding networkparameters that minimize the degree to which the equation is violated. In doingso, the method exploits the differentiability of neural networks to calculatethe spatial gradients analytically, meaning the network can be trained on itsown without ever needing solutions from a finite difference algorithm. EikoNetis rigorously tested on several velocity models and sampling methods todemonstrate robustness and versatility. Training and inference are highlyparallelized, making the approach well-suited for GPUs. EikoNet has low memoryoverhead, and further avoids the need for travel-time lookup tables. Thedeveloped approach has important applications to earthquake hypocenterinversion, ray multi-pathing, and tomographic modeling, as well as to otherfields beyond seismology where ray tracing is essential.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recently developed physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving for the scattered wavefield in the Helmholtz equation showed large potential in seismic modeling because of its flexibility, low memory requirement, and no limitations on the shape of the solution space. However, the predicted solutions were somewhat smooth and the convergence of the training was slow. Thus, we propose a modified PINN using sinusoidal activation functions and positional encoding, aiming to accelerate the convergence and fit better. We transform},

  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {Implicit Neural Representations (INR) use multilayer perceptrons to representhigh-frequency functions in low-dimensional problem domains. Recently theserepresentations achieved state-of-the-art results on tasks related to complex3D objects and scenes. A core problem is the representation of highly detailedsignals, which is tackled using networks with periodic activation functions(SIRENs) or applying Fourier mappings to the input. This work analyzes theconnection between the two methods and shows that a Fourier mapped perceptronis structurally like one hidden layer SIREN. Furthermore, we identify therelationship between the previously proposed Fourier mapping and the generald-dimensional Fourier series, leading to an integer lattice mapping. Moreover,we modify a progressive training strategy to work on arbitrary Fourier mappingsand show that it improves the generalization of the interpolation task. Lastly,we compare the different mappings on the image regression and novel viewsynthesis tasks. We confirm the previous finding that the main contributor tothe mapping performance is the size of the embedding and standard deviation ofits elements.},

  ABSTRACT = {Traditional approaches for learning 3D object categories have beenpredominantly trained and evaluated on synthetic datasets due to theunavailability of real 3D-annotated category-centric data. Our main goal is tofacilitate advances in this field by collecting real-world data in a magnitudesimilar to the existing synthetic counterparts. The principal contribution ofthis work is thus a large-scale dataset, called Common Objects in 3D, with realmulti-view images of object categories annotated with camera poses and groundtruth 3D point clouds. The dataset contains a total of 1.5 million frames fromnearly 19,000 videos capturing objects from 50 MS-COCO categories and, as such,it is significantly larger than alternatives both in terms of the number ofcategories and objects. We exploit this new dataset to conduct one of the firstlarge-scale "in-the-wild" evaluations of several new-view-synthesis andcategory-centric 3D reconstruction methods. Finally, we contribute NerFormer -a novel neural rendering method that leverages the powerful Transformer toreconstruct an object given a small number of its views.

  ABSTRACT = {We investigate the problem of learning to generate 3D parametric surfacerepresentations for novel object instances, as seen from one or more views.Previous work on learning shape reconstruction from multiple views usesdiscrete representations such as point clouds or voxels, while continuoussurface generation approaches lack multi-view consistency. We address theseissues by designing neural networks capable of generating high-qualityparametric 3D surfaces which are also consistent between views. Furthermore,the generated 3D surfaces preserve accurate image pixel to 3D surface pointcorrespondences, allowing us to lift texture information to reconstruct shapeswith rich geometry and appearance. Our method is supervised and trained on apublic dataset of shapes from common object categories. Quantitative resultsindicate that our method significantly outperforms previous work, whilequalitative results demonstrate the high quality of our reconstructions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many computer vision problems face difficulties when imaging through turbulent refractive media (eg, air and water) due to the refraction and scattering of light. These effects cause geometric distortion that requires either handcrafted physical priors or supervised learning methods to remove. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised network to recover the latent distortion-free image. The key idea is to model non-rigid distortions as deformable grids. Our network consists of a grid deformer that estimates the distortion field and an image},

  EPRINT = {2106.05965v1},
  ARCHIVEPREFIX = {arXiv},
  PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
  ABSTRACT = {Single image pose estimation is a fundamental problem in many vision androbotics tasks, and existing deep learning approaches suffer by not completelymodeling and handling: i) uncertainty about the predictions, and ii) symmetricobjects with multiple (sometimes infinite) correct poses. To this end, weintroduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions onSO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neuralnetwork that estimates the probability given the input image and a candidatepose. Grid sampling or gradient ascent can be used to find the most likelypose, but it is also possible to evaluate the probability at any pose, enablingreasoning about symmetries and uncertainty. This is the most general way ofrepresenting distributions on manifolds, and to showcase the rich expressivepower, we introduce a dataset of challenging symmetric and nearly-symmetricobjects. We require no supervision on pose uncertainty -- the model trains onlywith a single pose per example. Nonetheless, our implicit model is highlyexpressive to handle complex distributions over 3D poses, while still obtainingaccurate pose estimation on standard non-ambiguous environments, achievingstate-of-the-art performance on Pascal3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3) benchmarks.},
