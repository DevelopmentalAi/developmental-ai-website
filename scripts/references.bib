    ABSTRACT = {Recent deep networks that directly handle points in a point set, e.g.,
    PointNet, have been state-of-the-art for supervised learning tasks on point
    clouds such as classification and segmentation. In this work, a novel
    end-to-end deep auto-encoder is proposed to address unsupervised learning
    challenges on point clouds. On the encoder side, a graph-based enhancement is
    enforced to promote local structures on top of PointNet. Then, a novel
    folding-based decoder deforms a canonical 2D grid onto the underlying 3D object
    surface of a point cloud, achieving low reconstruction errors even for objects
    with delicate structures. The proposed decoder only uses about 7% parameters of
    a decoder with fully-connected neural networks, yet leads to a more
    discriminative representation that achieves higher linear SVM classification
    accuracy than the benchmark. In addition, the proposed decoder structure is
    shown, in theory, to be a generic architecture that is able to reconstruct an
    arbitrary point cloud from a 2D grid. Our code is available at

    improved precision and generalization capabilities, and the possibility to
    generate a shape of arbitrary resolution without memory issues. We demonstrate
    these benefits and compare to strong baselines on the ShapeNet benchmark for
    two applications: (i) auto-encoding shapes, and (ii) single-view reconstruction
    from a still image. We also provide results showing its potential for other

    ABSTRACT = {The reconstruction of a discrete surface from a point cloud is a fundamental
    geometry processing problem that has been studied for decades, with many
    methods developed. We propose the use of a deep neural network as a geometric
    prior for surface reconstruction. Specifically, we overfit a neural network
    representing a local chart parameterization to part of an input point cloud
    using the Wasserstein distance as a measure of approximation. By jointly
    fitting many such networks to overlapping parts of the point cloud, while
    enforcing a consistency condition, we compute a manifold atlas. By sampling
    this atlas, we can produce a dense reconstruction of the surface approximating
    the input cloud. The entire procedure does not require any training data or
    explicit regularization, yet, we show that it is able to perform remarkably
    well: not introducing typical overfitting artifacts, and approximating sharp
    features closely at the same time. We experimentally show that this geometric
    prior produces good results for both man-made objects containing sharp features
    and smoother organic objects, as well as noisy inputs. We compare our method
    with a number of well-known reconstruction methods on a standard surface
    reconstruction benchmark.},

    ABSTRACT = {We advocate the use of implicit fields for learning generative models of
    shapes and introduce an implicit field decoder, called IM-NET, for shape
    generation, aimed at improving the visual quality of the generated shapes. An
    implicit field assigns a value to each point in 3D space, so that a shape can
    be extracted as an iso-surface. IM-NET is trained to perform this assignment by
    means of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, along
    with a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicates
    whether the point is outside the shape or not. By replacing conventional
    decoders by our implicit decoder for representation learning (via IM-AE) and
    shape generation (via IM-GAN), we demonstrate superior results for tasks such
    as generative shape modeling, interpolation, and single-view 3D reconstruction,

    ABSTRACT = {With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based approaches for 3D
    reconstruction have gained popularity. However, unlike for images, in 3D there
    is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory
    efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary
    topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction
    approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a
    restricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new
    representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks
    implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a
    deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our
    representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution
    without excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can
    efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of
    input. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and
    quantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single
    images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe that
    occupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety of
    learning-based 3D tasks.},

    ABSTRACT = {Computer graphics, 3D computer vision and robotics communities have produced
    multiple approaches to representing 3D geometry for rendering and

    compression capabilities. In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learned
    continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a class of shapes
    that enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completion
    from partial and noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart,
    represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude of
    a point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and the
    sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape,
    hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as the
    zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the
    classification of space as being part of the shapes interior or not. While
    classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically
    represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class
    of shapes. Furthermore, we show state-of-the-art performance for learned 3D

    infer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multiple
    input images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as

    to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu can produce
    high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a
    person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation,
    can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned
    with the input image. Furthermore, while previous techniques are designed to
    process either a single image or multiple views, PIFu extends naturally to
    arbitrary number of views. We demonstrate high-resolution and robust

    ABSTRACT = {Unsupervised learning with generative models has the potential of discovering
    rich representations of 3D scenes. While geometric deep learning has explored

    (SRNs), a continuous, 3D-structure-aware scene representation that encodes both
    geometry and appearance. SRNs represent scenes as continuous functions that map
    world coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. By
    formulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm,
    SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses,
    without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes across
    scenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process. We

    ABSTRACT = {Modeling and rendering of dynamic scenes is challenging, as natural scenes
    often contain complex phenomena such as thin structures, evolving topology,
    translucency, scattering, occlusion, and biological motion. Mesh-based
    reconstruction and tracking often fail in these cases, and other approaches
    (e.g., light field video) typically rely on constrained viewing conditions,
    which limit interactivity. We circumvent these difficulties by presenting a
    learning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by the
    integral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach is
    supervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does not
    require explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has two
    primary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images
    into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation
    that enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, our
    construction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-space
    rendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latent
    representation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel content
    sequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations of
    voxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structure
    implemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatly
    improves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jagged
    motion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-based
    representations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications where
    the highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a case

    EPRINT = {1911.00767v1},
    ARCHIVEPREFIX = {arXiv},
    PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
    ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in 3D deep learning have shown that it is possible to train
    highly effective deep models for 3D shape generation, directly from 2D images.
    This is particularly interesting since the availability of 3D models is still
    limited compared to the massive amount of accessible 2D images, which is
    invaluable for training. The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a key
    factor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicit
    representations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range of
    shape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-based
    representations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handle
    varying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complex
    shapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We address
    the fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inference
    without the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remains
    nontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicit
    surfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision;
    and (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as local
    smoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known to
    be a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we propose
    a novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-field
    supervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces,
    which provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstrate
    the effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3D
    shape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques both
    quantitatively and qualitatively.},

    Unfortunately, these approaches are currently restricted to voxel- and

    this work, we propose a differentiable rendering formulation for implicit shape
    and texture representations. Implicit representations have recently gained
    popularity as they represent shape and texture continuously. Our key insight is
    that depth gradients can be derived analytically using the concept of implicit
    differentiation. This allows us to learn implicit shape and texture
    representations directly from RGB images. We experimentally show that our

    loss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input point

    regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level set surfaces,
    avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of this

    ABSTRACT = {While many works focus on 3D reconstruction from images, in this paper, we
    focus on 3D shape reconstruction and completion from a variety of 3D inputs,
    which are deficient in some respect: low and high resolution voxels, sparse and
    dense point clouds, complete or incomplete. Processing of such 3D inputs is an
    increasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are
    becoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision
    algorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as
    they produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations
    in reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not
    retained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we
    propose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs,
    can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input
    data retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but
    critically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data,
    and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two
    crucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape,
    we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which
    is aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second,
    instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep
    features extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that
    this forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape
    structure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclidean
    transformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets clearly outperform prior
    work in 3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly more

    ABSTRACT = {Recently, implicit neural representations have gained popularity for
    learning-based 3D reconstruction. While demonstrating promising results, most
    implicit approaches are limited to comparably simple geometry of single objects
    and do not scale to more complicated or large-scale scenes. The key limiting
    factor of implicit methods is their simple fully-connected network architecture
    which does not allow for integrating local information in the observations or
    incorporating inductive biases such as translational equivariance. In this
    paper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicit
    representation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. By
    combining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our model
    incorporates inductive biases, enabling structured reasoning in 3D space. We
    investigate the effectiveness of the proposed representation by reconstructing
    complex geometry from noisy point clouds and low-resolution voxel
    representations. We empirically find that our method enables the fine-grained
    implicit 3D reconstruction of single objects, scales to large indoor scenes,
    and generalizes well from synthetic to real data.},

    ABSTRACT = {We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing
    novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric

    scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is
    a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location $(x,y,z)$ and viewing
    direction $(\theta, \phi)$) and whose output is the volume density and
    view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views
    by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering
    techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because
    volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to
    optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We
    describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render
    photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance,
    and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view

    (SDF) representation used in traditional surface reconstruction systems with a
    set of locally learned continuous SDFs defined by a neural network, inspired by
    recent work such as DeepSDF. Unlike DeepSDF, which represents an object-level
    SDF with a neural network and a single latent code, we store a grid of
    independent latent codes, each responsible for storing information about
    surfaces in a small local neighborhood. This decomposition of scenes into local
    shapes simplifies the prior distribution that the network must learn, and also
    enables efficient inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
    generalization power of DeepLS by showing object shape encoding and
    reconstructions of full scenes, where DeepLS delivers high compression,

    PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
    ABSTRACT = {The recent success of implicit neural scene representations has presented a
    viable new method for how we capture and store 3D scenes. Unlike conventional
    3D representations, such as point clouds, which explicitly store scene
    properties in discrete, localized units, these implicit representations encode
    a scene in the weights of a neural network which can be queried at any
    coordinate to produce these same scene properties. Thus far, implicit
    representations have primarily been optimized to estimate only the appearance
    and/or 3D geometry information in a scene. We take the next step and
    demonstrate that an existing implicit representation (SRNs) is actually
    multi-modal; it can be further leveraged to perform per-point semantic
    segmentation while retaining its ability to represent appearance and geometry.
    To achieve this multi-modal behavior, we utilize a semi-supervised learning
    strategy atop the existing pre-trained scene representation. Our method is
    simple, general, and only requires a few tens of labeled 2D segmentation masks
    in order to achieve dense 3D semantic segmentation. We explore two novel
    applications for this semantically aware implicit neural scene representation:
    3D novel view and semantic label synthesis given only a single input RGB image
    or 2D label mask, as well as 3D interpolation of appearance and semantics.},

    ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in image-based 3D human shape estimation have been driven by
    the significant improvement in representation power afforded by deep neural
    networks. Although current approaches have demonstrated the potential in real
    world settings, they still fail to produce reconstructions with the level of
    detail often present in the input images. We argue that this limitation stems
    primarily form two conflicting requirements; accurate predictions require large
    context, but precise predictions require high resolution. Due to memory
    limitations in current hardware, previous approaches tend to take low
    resolution images as input to cover large spatial context, and produce less
    precise (or low resolution) 3D estimates as a result. We address this
    limitation by formulating a multi-level architecture that is end-to-end
    trainable. A coarse level observes the whole image at lower resolution and
    focuses on holistic reasoning. This provides context to an fine level which
    estimates highly detailed geometry by observing higher-resolution images. We
    demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
    state-of-the-art techniques on single image human shape reconstruction by fully

    ABSTRACT = {While 2D generative adversarial networks have enabled high-resolution image
    synthesis, they largely lack an understanding of the 3D world and the image
    formation process. Thus, they do not provide precise control over camera
    viewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approaches
    leverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination with
    differentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low image
    resolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g.,
    the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a
    generative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful for
    novel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-based
    representations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization of
    the 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties while
    degrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. By
    introducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesis
    of high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D images
    alone. We systematically analyze our approach on several challenging synthetic

    ABSTRACT = {Photo-realistic free-viewpoint rendering of real-world scenes using classical
    computer graphics techniques is challenging, because it requires the difficult
    step of capturing detailed appearance and geometry models. Recent studies have
    demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that
    implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However,
    existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the
    limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of
    camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from
    these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In
    this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene
    representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines
    a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to
    model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying
    voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set
    of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel
    views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene
    content. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art
    (namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving
    higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel
    representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene
    composition. We also demonstrate several challenging tasks, including

    ABSTRACT = {A neural implicit outputs a number indicating whether the given query point

    comes at the cost of reconstruction accuracy for any _single_ shape. Training a
    specific network for each 3D shape, a _weight-encoded_ neural implicit may
    forgo the latent vector and focus reconstruction accuracy on the details of a
    single shape. While previously considered as an intermediary representation for
    3D scanning tasks or as a toy-problem leading up to latent-encoding tasks,
    weight-encoded neural implicits have not yet been taken seriously as a 3D shape
    representation. In this paper, we establish that weight-encoded neural
    implicits meet the criteria of a first-class 3D shape representation. We
    introduce a suite of technical contributions to improve reconstruction
    accuracy, convergence, and robustness when learning the signed distance field
    induced by a polygonal mesh -- the _de facto_ standard representation. Viewed
    as a lossy compression, our conversion outperforms standard techniques from
    geometry processing. Compared to previous latent- and weight-encoded neural
    implicits we demonstrate superior robustness, scalability, and performance.},

    inefficient and limited in resolution. Recent work, predicts RGB color at every

    partial and incomplete 3D scans. IF-Nets have recently achieved
    state-of-the-art results on 3D geometry completion using a multi-scale deep
    feature encoding, but the outputs lack texture. In this work, we generalize
    IF-Nets to texture completion from partial textured scans of humans and
    arbitrary objects. Our key insight is that 3D texture completion benefits from
    incorporating local and global deep features extracted from both the 3D partial
    texture and completed geometry. Specifically, given the partial 3D texture and
    the 3D geometry completed with IF-Nets, our model successfully in-paints the
    missing texture parts in consistence with the completed geometry. Our model won

    ABSTRACT = {Dense 3D object reconstruction from a single image has recently witnessed
    remarkable advances, but supervising neural networks with ground-truth 3D
    shapes is impractical due to the laborious process of creating paired
    image-shape datasets. Recent efforts have turned to learning 3D reconstruction
    without 3D supervision from RGB images with annotated 2D silhouettes,
    dramatically reducing the cost and effort of annotation. These techniques,
    however, remain impractical as they still require multi-view annotations of the
    same object instance during training. As a result, most experimental efforts to
    date have been limited to synthetic datasets. In this paper, we address this
    issue and propose SDF-SRN, an approach that requires only a single view of
    objects at training time, offering greater utility for real-world scenarios.
    SDF-SRN learns implicit 3D shape representations to handle arbitrary shape
    topologies that may exist in the datasets. To this end, we derive a novel
    differentiable rendering formulation for learning signed distance functions

    ARCHIVEPREFIX = {arXiv},
    PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
    ABSTRACT = {In this work we target a learnable output representation that allows
    continuous, high resolution outputs of arbitrary shape. Recent works represent
    3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previous
    barriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However,
    neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which divide
    the space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of a
    scene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are not
    closed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing
    (objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability to
    output open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a
    neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for
    arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high
    resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data,
    and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF
    allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also
    show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a
    slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target
    regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been
    exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that
    NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes
    with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that
    NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open
    surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions. Code is available for

    incorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative model
    leads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes as
    compositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one or
    multiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes and
    appearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collections
    without any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with a

    based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key
    observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper
    and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and
    dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together,
    these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant
    inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show
    that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is
    provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly
    rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides

    ABSTRACT = {Neural rendering techniques combining machine learning with geometric
    reasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizing
    novel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out the
    Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input
    coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume
    density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an
    unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only
    applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried
    from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends
    neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render
    novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single}
    camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an
    additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main
    stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps
    this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time.
    Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once
    the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the
    camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We
    demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under
    rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic

    ABSTRACT = {Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing and
    is at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications,
    neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view
    synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental
    obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and
    memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the
    rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring
    hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate
    those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic
    integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to
    integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate
    the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The
    graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble
    the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the
    fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite
    integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural
    rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality:
    improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly
    reduced image quality.},

    of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of
    the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional
    morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We
    use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and
    demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from
    monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In

    ABSTRACT = {Decomposing a scene into its shape, reflectance, and illumination is a
    challenging but essential problem in computer vision and graphics. This problem
    is inherently more challenging when the illumination is not a single light
    source under laboratory conditions but is instead an unconstrained
    environmental illumination. Though recent work has shown that implicit
    representations can be used to model the radiance field of an object, these
    techniques only enable view synthesis and not relighting. Additionally,
    evaluating these radiance fields is resource and time-intensive. By decomposing
    a scene into explicit representations, any rendering framework can be leveraged
    to generate novel views under any illumination in real-time. NeRD is a method
    that achieves this decomposition by introducing physically-based rendering to
    neural radiance fields. Even challenging non-Lambertian reflectances, complex
    geometry, and unknown illumination can be decomposed into high-quality models.

    remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis - synthesizing
    photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we
    investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free,
    RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation and
    rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that
    no object mesh models are available during either training or test time.
    Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the
    residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image.
    In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement
    for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of

    faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and
    continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware
    grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps
    every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent
    emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is
    employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper
    body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D

    learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this
    ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames.
    To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which
    assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the
    same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the
    observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh
    also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations

    Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in

    models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such

    representation for 3D shapes. State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF
    with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with
    implicit surfaces. Rendering with these large networks is, however,
    computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the
    network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time
    graphics. We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first
    time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving
    state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit
    surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with
    multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF
    interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our
    novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary
    LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3
    orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to
    previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction
    quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.},

    ABSTRACT = {While deep learning has reshaped the classical motion capture pipeline,
    generative, analysis-by-synthesis elements are still in use to recover fine
    details if a high-quality 3D model of the user is available. Unfortunately,
    obtaining such a model for every user a priori is challenging, time-consuming,
    and limits the application scenarios. We propose a novel test-time optimization
    approach for monocular motion capture that learns a volumetric body model of
    the user in a self-supervised manner. To this end, our approach combines the
    advantages of neural radiance fields with an articulated skeleton
    representation. Our proposed skeleton embedding serves as a common reference
    that links constraints across time, thereby reducing the number of required
    camera views from traditionally dozens of calibrated cameras, down to a single
    uncalibrated one. As a starting point, we employ the output of an off-the-shelf
    model that predicts the 3D skeleton pose. The volumetric body shape and
    appearance is then learned from scratch, while jointly refining the initial
    pose estimate. Our approach is self-supervised and does not require any
    additional ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape. We
    demonstrate that our novel combination of a discriminative pose estimation
    technique with surface-free analysis-by-synthesis outperforms purely
    discriminative monocular pose estimation approaches and generalizes well to

    Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently gained popularity due to its remarkable

    end-to-end framework, termed NeRF--, for training NeRF models given only RGB
    images, without pre-computed camera parameters. Specifically, we show that the
    camera parameters, including both intrinsics and extrinsics, can be
    automatically discovered via joint optimisation during the training of the NeRF
    model. On the standard LLFF benchmark, our model achieves comparable novel view
    synthesis results compared to the baseline trained with COLMAP pre-computed

    render new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they represent
    faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize to

    ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in implicit neural representations show great promise when it
    comes to generating numerical solutions to partial differential equations

    parameterized neural networks to define, in a mesh-free manner, signals that
    are highly-detailed, continuous, and fully differentiable. Most prior works aim
    to exploit these benefits in order to solve PDE-governed forward problems, or
    associated inverse problems that are defined by a small number of parameters.
    In this work, we present a novel machine learning approach to tackle topology
    optimization (TO) problems. Topology optimization refers to an important class
    of inverse problems that typically feature very high-dimensional parameter
    spaces and objective landscapes which are highly non-linear. To effectively
    leverage neural representations in the context of TO problems, we use
    multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize both density and displacement
    fields. Using sensitivity analysis with a moving mean squared error, we show
    that our formulation can be used to efficiently minimize traditional structural
    compliance objectives. As we show through our experiments, a major benefit of
    our approach is that it enables self-supervised learning of continuous solution

    points. We demonstrate that this representation can be reconstructed using only

    drawbacks we aim to address with our work. Triangle meshes have difficulty
    modeling thin structures like hair, volumetric representations like Neural
    Volumes are too low-resolution given a reasonable memory budget, and
    high-resolution implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields are too
    slow for use in real-time applications. We present Mixture of Volumetric
    Primitives (MVP), a representation for rendering dynamic 3D content that
    combines the completeness of volumetric representations with the efficiency of
    primitive-based rendering, e.g., point-based or mesh-based methods. Our
    approach achieves this by leveraging spatially shared computation with a
    deconvolutional architecture and by minimizing computation in empty regions of
    space with volumetric primitives that can move to cover only occupied regions.
    Our parameterization supports the integration of correspondence and tracking
    constraints, while being robust to areas where classical tracking fails, such
    as around thin or translucent structures and areas with large topological
    variability. MVP is a hybrid that generalizes both volumetric and
    primitive-based representations. Through a series of extensive experiments we
    demonstrate that it inherits the strengths of each, while avoiding many of

    ABSTRACT = {The recent research explosion around implicit neural representations, such as
    NeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality
    scene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one major
    limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is
    the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each
    view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural
    representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time
    applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of
    samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples
    are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To
    this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations
    for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a
    classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically
    warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than
    directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,
    our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step
    and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we
    reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on
    available ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent acceleration
    methods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not require

    methods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D face
    models to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically,
    the feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicit

    ABSTRACT = {The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene
    with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are
    excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene
    content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling
    by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because
    rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times.
    Our solution, which we call "mip-NeRF" (a la "mipmap"), extends NeRF to
    represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering
    anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable
    aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine
    details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to
    NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with
    NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we
    present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force
    supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.},

    ABSTRACT = {We introduce a method to render Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in real time
    using PlenOctrees, an octree-based 3D representation which supports
    view-dependent effects. Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150
    FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without
    sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform
    free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent
    effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a
    PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,
    we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.
    Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical
    harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input
    to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly
    optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or
    better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree
    optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need
    to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering
    approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and
    product visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems. PlenOctrees

    the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining
    this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is
    accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model

    representation with learned feature vectors. The resulting scene representation
    retains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependent

    labels are human-defined properties.
    We extend neural radiance fields (NeRF) to jointly encode semantics with
    appearance and geometry, so that complete and accurate 2D semantic labels can
    be achieved using a small amount of in-place annotations specific to the scene.
    The intrinsic multi-view consistency and smoothness of NeRF benefit semantics
    by enabling sparse labels to efficiently propagate. We show the benefit of this
    approach when labels are either sparse or very noisy in room-scale scenes. We
    demonstrate its advantageous properties in various interesting applications

    across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training

    three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on
    generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are

    wearable and portable virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays. Recent
    approaches to combat this problem include remote rendering/streaming and neural
    representations of 3D assets. These approaches have redefined the traditional
    local storage-rendering pipeline by distributed computing or compression of

    ABSTRACT = {Tremendous progress in deep generative models has led to photorealistic image
    synthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the
    two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our
    world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are
    3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to
    the image plane. This leads to impressive 3D consistency, but incorporating
    such a bias comes at a price: the camera needs to be modeled as well. Current
    approaches assume fixed intrinsics and a predefined prior over camera pose
    ranges. As a result, parameter tuning is typically required for real-world
    data, and results degrade if the data distribution is not matched. Our key
    hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator
    leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we
    propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading
    to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from
    raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative
    model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data
    distribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit control

    particular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-space

    parametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spaces
    to fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametric
    model, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurate
    and detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMs
    improve notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art in

    lighting. However, these models are specialized for constrained viewing of
    single objects, such as cars or faces. Due to the size and complexity of
    realistic indoor environments, existing models lack the representational
    capacity to adequately capture them. Our decomposition scheme scales to larger
    and more complex scenes while preserving details and diversity, and the learned
    prior enables high-quality rendering from viewpoints that are significantly
    different from observed viewpoints. When compared to existing models, GSN
    produces quantitatively higher-quality scene renderings across several

    ABSTRACT = {We present DietNeRF, a 3D neural scene representation estimated from a few
    images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric
    representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered
    from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to
    reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for
    challenging 360{\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image
    reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve
    few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic
    consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF
    is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from
    the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different,
    random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary
    poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as
    CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse
    single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language
    supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of
    few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with
    as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and
    produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.},

    ABSTRACT = {Getting representations of multiple objects or scenes is a raising research topic in Machine Learning (ML) community. Here, we propose a multi-scene representation model that can learn the representation of complex scenes and reconstruct them in high resolution given novel viewing directions. Our method represents a single scene with fully-connected layers. Each set of fully-connected layers are controlled by hyper-networks for multiple scenes modeling. For each scene, we take 3D coordinates (x, y, z) and 2D view-point orientations (Î¸, É¸) as inputs. A set of fully-connected layers output volume density and RGB values at given 3D spatial positions. Then, we render the output volume density and RGB values along the camera rays into images using volume density rendering techniques. During training process, we optimize a continuous volume scene function with a small amount of input viewing directions. By designing versatile embedding module and multi-scene representation networks, our model can render photographic images with novel viewing directions for different complex scenes. Experiment results demonstrate the neural rendering and multi-scene representation abilities of our model. Several thorough experiments show that our method outperforms previous model on both reconstruction precision and scenes generation ability from novel viewing directions.}

    or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we
    apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a
    novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that
    after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not

    propose to utilize the synergies between grasp affordance and 3D reconstruction

    advantage of deep implicit functions, a continuous and memory-efficient

    conducted on a clutter removal task, where the robot clears cluttered objects
    by grasping them one at a time. The experimental results in simulation and on
    the real robot have demonstrated that the use of implicit neural

    free-viewpoint rendering approach using a catadioptric imaging system with

    of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D
    location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes
    without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully
    differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover,
    through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over

    ABSTRACT = {We present SCANimate, an end-to-end trainable framework that takes raw 3D
    scans of a clothed human and turns them into an animatable avatar. These
    avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves
    and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or
    surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model,
    like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of
    the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate
    significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated
    transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle consistency in the
    posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised
    learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling
    articulated deformations without template-based surface registration.
    Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling
    pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit
    function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose
    correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local
    pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and
    improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is
    limited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling to
    generate a fully textured avatar. We demonstrate our approach on various

    ABSTRACT = {Neural implicit surface representations have emerged as a promising paradigm
    to capture 3D shapes in a continuous and resolution-independent manner.
    However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing
    approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points.
    However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent
    and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce
    SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for
    polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward
    deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined
    in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen
    poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging
    since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not
    be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that
    finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root
    finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling
    end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to
    state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes
    better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate our method in

    methods are typically optimized for a single signal. We present a new
    representation that generalizes to multiple instances and achieves
    state-of-the-art fidelity. We use a dual-MLP architecture to encode the
    signals. A synthesis network creates a functional mapping from a
    low-dimensional input (e.g. pixel-position) to the output domain (e.g. RGB
    color). A modulation network maps a latent code corresponding to the target
    signal to parameters that modulate the periodic activations of the synthesis
    network. We also propose a local-functional representation which enables
    generalization. The signal's domain is partitioned into a regular grid,with
    each tile represented by a latent code. At test time, the signal is encoded

    only sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspired
    by classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points by
    finding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color and
    density for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in the
    input images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise
    similarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns
    structure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the
    DTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10
    sparse and spread-out views as input. We show that 10-15 minutes of fine-tuning
    further improve the results, achieving significantly sharper, more detailed
    results than scene-specific models. The code, model, and videos are available

    ABSTRACT = {We present GANcraft, an unsupervised neural rendering framework for
    generating photorealistic images of large 3D block worlds such as those created
    in Minecraft. Our method takes a semantic block world as input, where each
    block is assigned a semantic label such as dirt, grass, or water. We represent
    the world as a continuous volumetric function and train our model to render
    view-consistent photorealistic images for a user-controlled camera. In the
    absence of paired ground truth real images for the block world, we devise a
    training technique based on pseudo-ground truth and adversarial training. This
    stands in contrast to prior work on neural rendering for view synthesis, which
    requires ground truth images to estimate scene geometry and view-dependent
    appearance. In addition to camera trajectory, GANcraft allows user control over
    both scene semantics and output style. Experimental results with comparison to
    strong baselines show the effectiveness of GANcraft on this novel task of
    photorealistic 3D block world synthesis. The project website is available at

    represent articulated shapes with a disentangled latent space, where we have
    separate codes for encoding shape and articulation. We assume no prior
    knowledge on part geometry, articulation status, joint type, joint axis, and
    joint location. With this disentangled continuous representation, we
    demonstrate that we can control the articulation input and animate unseen
    instances with unseen joint angles. Furthermore, we propose a Test-Time

    factorization that allows for (i) compactly caching a deep radiance map at each

    estimate the pixel values in the rendered image. Extensive experiments show

    requires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image
    reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both
    from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky),
    we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the
    Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect
    illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field
    as a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of
    these factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared
    to NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full
    3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, and
    transient object filtering, without any explicit shape supervision.},

    ABSTRACT = {Reconstructing dynamic, time-varying scenes with computed tomography (4D-CT)
    is a challenging and ill-posed problem common to industrial and medical
    settings. Existing 4D-CT reconstructions are designed for sparse sampling
    schemes that require fast CT scanners to capture multiple, rapid revolutions
    around the scene in order to generate high quality results. However, if the
    scene is moving too fast, then the sampling occurs along a limited view and is
    difficult to reconstruct due to spatiotemporal ambiguities. In this work, we
    design a reconstruction pipeline using implicit neural representations coupled
    with a novel parametric motion field warping to perform limited view 4D-CT
    reconstruction of rapidly deforming scenes. Importantly, we utilize a
    differentiable analysis-by-synthesis approach to compare with captured x-ray
    sinogram data in a self-supervised fashion. Thus, our resulting optimization
    method requires no training data to reconstruct the scene. We demonstrate that
    our proposed system robustly reconstructs scenes containing deformable and
    periodic motion and validate against state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
    demonstrate an ability to reconstruct continuous spatiotemporal representations
    of our scenes and upsample them to arbitrary volumes and frame rates

    ABSTRACT = {Recent neural rendering methods have demonstrated accurate view interpolation
    by predicting volumetric density and color with a neural network. Although such

    existing methods implicitly bake the complete scene light transport into a

    bidirectional scattering distribution functions, and indirect lighting effects.
    In contrast to traditional rendering pipelines, this prohibits changing surface
    reflectance, illumination, or composing other objects in the scene.
    In this work, we explicitly model the light transport between scene surfaces
    and we rely on traditional integration schemes and the rendering equation to
    reconstruct a scene. The proposed method allows BSDF recovery with unknown
    light conditions and classic light transports such as pathtracing. By learning
    decomposed transport with surface representations established in conventional
    rendering methods, the method naturally facilitates editing shape, reflectance,
    lighting and scene composition. The method outperforms NeRV for relighting
    under known lighting conditions, and produces realistic reconstructions for

    ABSTRACT = {Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience

    propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video
    generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The
    core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic
    entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time
    coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered
    representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the
    dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide
    range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous
    functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well
    as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised
    manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the
    spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle
    the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is
    further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a
    novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient
    training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework
    further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale
    and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create
    numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments

    ABSTRACT = {Some forms of novel visual media enable the viewer to explore a 3D scene from

    amounts of storage space, which we seek to reduce. Existing approaches for
    compressing 3D scenes are based on a separation of compression and rendering:
    each of the original views is compressed using traditional 2D image formats;
    the receiver decompresses the views and then performs the rendering. We unify
    these steps by directly compressing an implicit representation of the scene, a
    function that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field, which can
    then be queried to render arbitrary viewpoints. The function is implemented as
    a neural network and jointly trained for reconstruction as well as
    compressibility, in an end-to-end manner, with the use of an entropy penalty on
    the parameters. Our method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art
    conventional approach for scene compression, achieving simultaneously higher

    ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human
    model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a
    dynamic scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation
    fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby
    enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent
    the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes
    the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations
    cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural
    blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the
    skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human
    skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation
    correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can
    regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend
    weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new
    deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our

    ABSTRACT = {Neural representations have emerged as a new paradigm for applications in
    rendering, imaging, geometric modeling, and simulation. Compared to traditional
    representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly
    incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent
    improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent
    signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D
    shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a
    challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images
    at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few
    hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit
    network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources
    during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of
    interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition,
    similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network
    architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters,
    a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then,
    hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated
    using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network
    architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to
    nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in
    scale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated
    image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D
    shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces
    training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an

    ABSTRACT = {Rendering 3D scenes requires access to arbitrary viewpoints from the scene.
    Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images taken
    from the 3D scene that can reconstruct the scene back through interpolations,
    or (2) storing a representation of the 3D scene itself that already encodes
    views from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods have
    focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with
    image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the
    stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated
    procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored.
    In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional
    representation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress
    3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes as

    heartbeats from several fixed viewpoints determined by the lead positioning.
    However, it is often not satisfactory to visualize ECG signals in these fixed
    and limited views, as some clinically useful information is represented only
    from a few specific ECG viewpoints. For the first time, we propose a new
    concept, Electrocardio Panorama, which allows visualizing ECG signals from any
    queried viewpoints. To build Electrocardio Panorama, we assume that an
    underlying electrocardio field exists, representing locations, magnitudes, and
    directions of ECG signals. We present a Neural electrocardio field Network
    (Nef-Net), which first predicts the electrocardio field representation by using
    a sparse set of one or few input ECG views and then synthesizes Electrocardio
    Panorama based on the predicted representations. Specially, to better
    disentangle electrocardio field information from viewpoint biases, a new
    Angular Encoding is proposed to process viewpoint angles. Also, we propose a
    self-supervised learning approach called Standin Learning, which helps model
    the electrocardio field without direct supervision. Further, with very few
    modifications, Nef-Net can also synthesize ECG signals from scratch.
    Experiments verify that our Nef-Net performs well on Electrocardio Panorama
    synthesis, and outperforms the previous work on the auxiliary tasks (ECG view
    transformation and ECG synthesis from scratch). The codes and the division
    labels of cardiac cycles and ECG deflections on Tianchi ECG and PTB datasets
    are available at https://github.com/WhatAShot/Electrocardio-Panorama.},

    ABSTRACT = {A neural radiance field (NeRF) is a scene model supporting high-quality view
    synthesis, optimized per scene. In this paper, we explore enabling user editing
    of a category-level NeRF - also known as a conditional radiance field - trained
    on a shape category. Specifically, we introduce a method for propagating coarse
    2D user scribbles to the 3D space, to modify the color or shape of a local
    region. First, we propose a conditional radiance field that incorporates new
    modular network components, including a shape branch that is shared across
    object instances. Observing multiple instances of the same category, our model
    learns underlying part semantics without any supervision, thereby allowing the
    propagation of coarse 2D user scribbles to the entire 3D region (e.g., chair
    seat). Next, we propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets specific
    network components, which balances efficiency and accuracy. During user
    interaction, we formulate an optimization problem that both satisfies the
    user's constraints and preserves the original object structure. We demonstrate
    our approach on various editing tasks over three shape datasets and show that
    it outperforms prior neural editing approaches. Finally, we edit the appearance
    and shape of a real photograph and show that the edit propagates to

    novel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is
    represented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a
    corresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view
    rendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is
    characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D
    function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a
    deep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize
    the 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.
    Different from previous light field approaches which require dense view
    sampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by
    sampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,
    thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training

    ABSTRACT = {View synthesis methods using implicit continuous shape representations
    learned from a set of images, such as the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) method,
    have gained increasing attention due to their high quality imagery and
    scalability to high resolution. However, the heavy computation required by its
    volumetric approach prevents NeRF from being useful in practice; minutes are
    taken to render a single image of a few megapixels. Now, an image of a scene
    can be rendered in a level-of-detail manner, so we posit that a complicated
    region of the scene should be represented by a large neural network while a
    small neural network is capable of encoding a simple region, enabling a balance
    between efficiency and quality. Recursive-NeRF is our embodiment of this idea,
    providing an efficient and adaptive rendering and training approach for NeRF.
    The core of Recursive-NeRF learns uncertainties for query coordinates,
    representing the quality of the predicted color and volumetric intensity at
    each level. Only query coordinates with high uncertainties are forwarded to the
    next level to a bigger neural network with a more powerful representational
    capability. The final rendered image is a composition of results from neural
    networks of all levels. Our evaluation on three public datasets shows that
    Recursive-NeRF is more efficient than NeRF while providing state-of-the-art

    ABSTRACT = {In this work, we aim to address the 3D scene stylization problem - generating
    stylized images of the scene at arbitrary novel view angles. A straightforward
    solution is to combine existing novel view synthesis and image/video style
    transfer approaches, which often leads to blurry results or inconsistent
    appearance. Inspired by the high quality results of the neural radiance fields
    (NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views with
    the desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicit
    representation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance field model, and a
    hypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.
    In particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into
    the geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predict
    the parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To
    alleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage
    training procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and
    content losses with the neural radiance field model. After optimization, our
    model is able to render consistent novel views at arbitrary view angles with
    arbitrary style. Both quantitative evaluation and human subject study have
    demonstrated that the proposed method generates faithful stylization results

    reflectance of an object from posed multi-view images of the object illuminated
    by one unknown lighting condition. This enables the rendering of novel views of
    the object under arbitrary environment lighting and editing of the object's
    material properties. The key to our approach, which we call Neural Radiance
    Factorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric geometry of a Neural
    Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] representation of the object
    into a surface representation and then jointly refine the geometry while
    solving for the spatially-varying reflectance and the environment lighting.
    Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of surface normals, light
    visibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions
    (BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a re-rendering loss, simple
    smoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior learned from real-world BRDF

    separate shadows from albedo and synthesize realistic soft or hard shadows
    under arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor is able to recover convincing 3D

    While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and

    Emerging 3D-structured neural scene representations are a promising approach to

    representation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and
    appearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light
    field parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from
    an LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of
    evaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in
    3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we
    leverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view
    consistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image
    observation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity,
    and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field
    via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as
    the Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicit

    function derived from the medial axis transform (MAT) that makes available
    information about the underlying 3D geometry that is immediately useful for a
    number of downstream tasks. In particular, the medial field encodes the local
    thickness of a 3D shape, and enables O(1) projection of a query point onto the
    medial axis. To construct the medial field we require nothing but the SDF of
    the shape itself, thus allowing its straightforward incorporation in any
    application that relies on signed distance fields. Working in unison with the
    O(1) surface projection supported by the SDF, the medial field opens the door
    for an entirely new set of efficient, shape-aware operations on implicit

    address this by developing a model that first estimates the latent 3D structure
    of the scene, including the segmentation of any moving objects. It then
    predicts future frames by simulating the object and camera dynamics, and
    rendering the resulting views. Importantly, it is trained end-to-end using only
    the unsupervised objective of predicting future frames, without any 3D
    information nor segmentation annotations. Experiments on two challenging
    datasets of natural videos show that our model can estimate 3D structure and
    motion segmentation from a single frame, and hence generate plausible and

    ABSTRACT = {We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method, called NeuS, for
    reconstructing objects and scenes with high fidelity from 2D image inputs.
    Existing neural surface reconstruction approaches, such as DVR and IDR, require
    foreground mask as supervision, easily get trapped in local minima, and
    therefore struggle with the reconstruction of objects with severe
    self-occlusion or thin structures. Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel
    view synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce
    a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly
    complex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned
    implicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface
    constraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surface
    as the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a new
    volume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe that
    the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.
    bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that
    is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more
    accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments
    on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the
    state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for
    objects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.},

    Radiance Field with visible pixels collecting from omnidirectional viewing
    angles at a fixed center for the estimation of new viewing angles from varying

    PRIMARYCLASS = {cs.CV},
    ABSTRACT = {Neural volume rendering became increasingly popular recently due to its
    success in synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of input
    images. So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was
    modeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was
    extracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a
    noisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve
    geometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We
    achieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This
    is in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the
    volume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as
    Laplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance
    function (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three
    benefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in
    the neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity
    approximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.
    Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and
    radiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape
    and appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to
    challenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry
    reconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shape
    and appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of the
    two.},

    ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we aim to create generalizable and controllable neural signed
    distance fields (SDFs) that represent clothed humans from monocular depth
    observations. Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit
    representations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable
    avatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic
    cloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body
    scans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of
    effectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes
    and cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type
    optimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we
    propose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars,
    represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We
    achieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a
    hypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork is
    conditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms
    non-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to
    effectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus
    can be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We
    qualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms
    state-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our
    approach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes
    faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our meta-learned hypernetwork is very
    robust, being the first to generate avatars with realistic dynamic cloth
    deformations given as few as 8 monocular depth frames.},

    challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve generalization via
    adaptation, i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We
    employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate
    infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The
    updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead -- about 2.6ms on full HD
    resolution -- thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that

    ABSTRACT = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with
    unprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle
    dynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is
    through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each
    input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these
    deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as
    topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these
    deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by
    lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D
    radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through
    this "hyper-space". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model
    the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We
    evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between "moments",
    i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining
    visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show
    that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both
    tasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average
    error rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as

    be rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a
    unique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image
    feature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation
    convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural
    shape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape

    ABSTRACT = {One common failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models is fitting
    incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. We
    propose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning
    neural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth
    supervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to
    regularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering
    novel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require
    images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running
    structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that
    can be used as ``free" depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss
    to ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is
    close to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate
    images given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two
    training views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as
    well as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with
    these NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible

However, such weights cannot be accurately obtained in the application of chemiluminescence measurements due to the high physical complexity and computation resources required. Moreover, streaks arise in the results from ART method especially with imperfect projections. In this study, we propose a semi-case-wise learning-based method named Weight Encode Reconstruction Network (WERNet) to co-learn the target phantom intensities and the adaptive weight matrix of the case without labeling the target voxel set and thus offers a more applicable solution for computed tomography problems. Both numerical and experimental validations were conducted to evaluate the algorithm. In the numerical test, with the help of gradient normalization, the WERNet reconstructed voxel set with a high accuracy and showed a higher capability of denoising compared to the classic ART methods. In the experimental test, WERNet produces comparable results to the ART method while having a better performance in avoiding the streaks. Furthermore, with the adaptive weight matrix, WERNet is not sensitive to the ensemble intensity of the projection which shows much better robustness than ART method.},
